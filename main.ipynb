       "\"Provide me today's football news, kennisjager.info | Sitemap | Indeed, the.\\n\\nThe first is that the two-party system has become so polarized that it is difficult for a third party to gain traction. The second is that the electoral system itself is designed to make it difficult for third parties to succeed.\\n\\nIn the United States, the electoral system is set up in such a way that only two parties are likely to win the presidency. This is because of the way that electoral votes are allocated, with each state receiving a certain number of votes based on its population. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must win a majority of these electoral votes, which means they need to win a majority of the states.\\n\\nThis system favors the two major parties because they have established networks and infrastructure in place to win elections. Third parties often struggle to build this kind of support, especially in a country as large and diverse as the United States.\\n\\nAdditionally, the two-party system has become increasingly polarized in recent years, with both parties moving further to the left and right respectively. This makes it even more difficult for third parties to find a place in the political landscape, as they may be seen as too moderate or too extreme by voters.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, there have been some successful third parties in American history, such as the Progressive Party in the early 20th century and the Reform Party in the late 20th century. However, these examples are rare and third parties continue to face an uphill battle in the United States.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it is possible for third parties to succeed in other countries, the United States has a unique set of obstacles that make it difficult for them to gain traction. The two-party system and the electoral system itself work together to favor the major parties and make it challenging for third parties to break through.\""

      "Summary: This Is Anfield 2024: Ibrahima Konate and Trent Alexander-Arnold have both been given major boosts ahead of Euro 2024, while Luis Diaz has discussed his Liverpool future.   France arguably go into the Euros as favourites, not least because of the plethora of top-quality centre-backs at their disposal. Konate is one such figure, and it appears he has got the nod to start for Les Bleus ahead of their opener against Austria next Monday. According to La Parisien, the Liverpool defender will start ahead of Arsenal‘s William Saliba, partnering Bayern Munich’s Dayot Upamecano at the back. This is a big show of faith from Didier Deschamps, especially as Konate lost his place to Jarell Quansah at the end of the season.         What a season it has been for the young Ghanaian defender, who has made the step up from League One to the first team in just his second full season at Anfield.   It was a breakthrough season for QuansAH and our latest season review focuses on the 21-year-old, with Joanna Durkan assessing his campaign… • READ: League One obscurity to first choice at Liverpool – A meteoric rise for Jaredll Quinsah    Match of the night is Portugal vs. Republic of Ireland (7.45pm BST), as Diogo Jota comes up against Caoimhin Kelleher. Jota will be desperate to prove his worth as he pushes to starts for his country in the coming weeks, in a Portugal attack also featuring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Joao Felix and Rafael Leao.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ±    ±   ●●● ● ● ●● ●●● ● ● ●●   ● ■●● ■ ■ ■ ● ● ■ ● ■ ■● ● ■ ●  ■ ■  ■ ●  ■● ■ ●● ■  ● ●  ● ■\n",
      "Summary: This Is Anfield - Wataru Endo helped Japan finish off the second round of World Cup qualifiers with six wins from six, as Takumi Minamino scored in a 5-0 thrashing of Syria. It has been a perfect start to the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign for Japan, who on Tuesday ended the two round with a 100 percent record. After victories over Myanmar (twice, 3-0 and 4-0), Syria (2-1), North Korea (1-0, 2-1 and 1-0) and Iran (5-0 after forfeit), they hosted Syria in Hiroshima. They did just that, with a comprehensive win over an admittedly lowly side that saw Liverpool midfielder Endo start as captain and play 62 minutes.  Endo, who was an unused substitute last time out against Myanmar, made his 62nd appearance for Japan and his 15th since being named captain. He will now depart for a post-season break before joining up with his Liverpool team-mates for day one of pre-season. Mohamed Salah is also among those expected in Arne Slot‘s first squad at the AXA Training Centre, along with Curtis Jones, Harvey Elliott, Jarell Quansah, Stefan Bajcetic and Fabio Carvalho. Goals from Ayase Ueda, Ritsu Doan and a Thaer Krouma own goal put Japan 3-5 up before the half-hour, with Endo breaking up play and propelling his side forward for the opener.  Yuki Soma made it 4-5 after the break from the penalty spot, before a goal from former Liverpool forward Minaminos rounded off the win. It meant Japan finish the second phase of the qualifying campaign top of Group B with 18 points – and a nine-point lead over second-placed North Korea. They will now be drawn into one of three groups, with 10 more qualifiers to play before the top two from each group progresses to the tournament proper. Japan finished the first round of qualifying with five wins from five, while they started the second with four wins from four, and ended the first phase with three wins from three. Their second-round finish means they have also qualified for the 2027 Asian Cup which, if he is still at the club, would rule Endo out of action for Liverpool midway through the 20 26/27 campaign.

      "Summary: This Is Anfield Podcast: Fernando Torres: 'I am in no hurry to reach the top' Like former team-mate Xabi Alonso, Fernando Torres is eager to avoid any shortcuts to the top as a manager, as the next step in his coaching career proves. Alonso became the most coveted coach in Europe this year as he oversaw a double-winning campaign at Bayer Leverkusen that saw him only lose the Europa League final. He turned down job offers along the way and did so again this summer, including rejecting advances from Liverpool as he aims to keep his pace. It appears as though Torres is taking the same approach, with the former Liverpool striker confirmed in a new position on Tuesday. “I am at home and I feel an enormous responsibility since I decided to face this new stage,” Torres told Atletico’s official website. In three seasons in charge of Atletico Madrid U19s, Torres twice won the league and once the Champions Cup, achieving a double in the campaign just gone. But he will now test himself at a higher level, with Atletico B expressly designed to produce players for the first team. He added: “It is very important for me to be at home, to be with my team-mates and to be able to work with them in the best way possible, to do things better every day, face the challenges that come and the responsibility in the right way and at the same time knowing that I am not in a hurry.  “For me this is a great responsibility and I accept it as a great challenge with a lot of ambition and the peace of mind of knowing that we are prepared.” His words reflect those of Alonso throughout his own coaching career so far, with both “in no hurry” to reach a top. It is an admirable stance, with it no doubt that, if Torres continues to follow the trajectory he has, he will eventually be offered elite jobs. Perhaps that could even come at Anfield, after he shadowed Jurgen Klopp towards the end of March, having explained: ‘I’m not trying to be a coach, let’t see if I can do it. But coaching for Liverpool is a different thing, step-by-step.’ Like Alonso, Torres has taken a similar approach to his own career. That came after a steady progression in his fledging career on the touchline, which began in the Real Madrid academy\n",
      "Summary: This Is Anfield has learned that PGMOL, the refereeing board for the Premier League, have announced a new ‘player to match official’ programme designed to fast-track ex-players into jobs. It is often argued, particularly when it comes to VAR, that former players should be involved in the decision-making process due to their experience in the game. Put simply, it is near-impossible for officials to judge certain situations fairly without knowledge of how the game is played and how the laws of the game are interpreted, and it is also difficult for them to make the correct decisions when they are not in the middle of the action themselves – for example, in the case of the handball law. • READ: Paul Tierney made more VAR errors than ANY referee in the English Premier League In recent years, there have been a number of examples of former players who have gone on to become match officials, with the most high-profile example of a former player becoming a referee, serving for eight years as a Football League official after a career that saw him represent the likes of Huddersfield, Bradford and Chesterfield in the 1970s and 1980s. However, there has been little in the way of support from the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) for ex-footballers to pursue a career in refereeing. That may be about to change, however. That could soon change, with PGM OL announcing a new programme that will accelerate the development of ex-professional footballers and offer them the opportunity to move up the ladder into a career as a match official. In partnership with the PFA, the group is “looking to identify 10 to 12 current or former players to enrol on a three-year refereeing scholarship programme. “Alongside our commitment to developing our current officials, we aim to create the best possible environment to support and encourage current and former players and coaches to enhance their skills, knowledge and, ultimately, their qualities as match officials through this programme.” This will be in line with their elite referee development plan and is both supported and funded by the Premier Leagues, with “over 120” individuals already expressing interest.  The 10 to12 successful applicants will begin training later this summer, bringing the total number of applicants to “approximately 100”.  “We’ve made no secret that we are looking to broaden our pool of officials and entice\n",
      "Summary: This Is Anfield 2024 As Bayern Munich push for a leading centre-back signing this summer, movements in the market could present an opportunity for Liverpool. With it still early in the summer – the window being yet to even open in England – there has been little in the way of transfer activity so far across Europe. But movement can be expected soon, with Bayern among those pushing for deals that could kick off a merry-go-round of transfers. Kylian Mbappe’s switch to Real Madrid is undoubtedly the most high profile, with French defender Jeanuel Belocian‘s move from Rennes to Bayer Leverkusen otherwise the most costly. The Bundesliga club, who fell short of the title and finished third last season, are looking to sign a new centre-half, and it is understood that they are already in advanced talks with Bayer.  Sky Germany reporting there's an agreement between Bayern Munich and Jonathan Tah for the defender to join this summer.?? Negotiations between the clubs expect to start soon with Chelsea defender Levi Colwill an alternative if a move for Tah doesn't work out. pic.twitter.com/P2MTirVxJ1 — Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) June 10, 2024  Journalist Florian Plettenberg claims that Tah has reached a “total agreement” with Bayern, with the player informing Leverkuson of his desire to leave. However, if a deal cannot be brokered, it is explained that the club are “not excluded” that they could try for both. That is interesting from a Liverpool perspective, given there is ongoing interest in Colwill – who is eligible as a homegrown player – while also available as a left-back. New links with Colwill emerged at the end of May when the Daily Mail reported that Chelsea were “looking to sell” the England Under-21 international, with Liverpool “likely” to be one of the clubs interested.  It was explained that Chelsea are eager for Colwill to stay, having convinced him to sign an extension to his contract up to 2029 last summer, with an option to extend that by a further year.  However, that the England international continues to be linked with moves away from Stamford Bridge does suggest that there is a willingness in his camp to secure a transfer. Any deal would be expensive, of course, but Chelsea may be required to favour deals for their academy players to fall into\n",
      "Summary: This Is Anfield has learned that Trent Alexander-Arnold could finally get the recognition he deserves for England, with Gareth Southgate’s likely XI for the Euros now widely reported. Southgate has already cut Curtis Jones and Jarell Quansah from his provisional squad, though the young centre-back has been retained on the standby list. That would leave the only other Liverpool representative, Joe Gomez, among the substitutes, having made his case for a spot at left-back. According to a number of national journalists including the Times‘ Paul Joyce and the Telegraph‘s Matt Law, Liverpools No. 66 is slated for a first-choice role in Germany. In the buildup to the Euros, the Reds’ academy product has been one of the most consistent performers in the Premier League this season, and his performances in the warm-up games against Iceland and Bosnia and Herzegovina have earned him plenty of praise from the English media – which is a departure from the norm. That has led the England manager to consider starting Alexander- Arnold in the middle of the park for the Group C opener against Serbia on Sunday night. Largely operating in Southgate's midfield, the 25-year-old scored in the 3-0 warmup win over Bosnia with a header, and should have come away with an assist in the 1-0 defeat to Iceland. In fact, he was the only Liverpool player to register a shot on target in those two games, with his effort coming off the underside of the crossbar. Law and Joyce both report that Southgate is “seriously considering” starting the Liverpool man in central midfield against Serbia. In addition, Law adds that Alexander-Aarnold is in “pole position” to partner Declan Rice in a two-man midfield.  Conor Gallagher, Adam Wharton and Kobbie Mainoo are England’m other options, along with Jude Bellingham, but the Mail‘’S Sami Mokbel explains the latter is ‘earmarked for an advanced role.’  England face Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia in their group at the Euros. Law reports that England will see a back four of Kyle Walker, John Stones, Marc Guehi and Kieran Trippier in front of Jordan Pickford. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is expected to start at right-back, with Joe Gomez likely to play in\n",
      "Summary: This Is Anfield 2024: Virgil van Dijk and Ryan Gravenberch boost their chances of featuring for the Netherlands ahead of their Euro 2024 campaign, while Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners both pull out of the squad due to injury. The Netherlands are not considered among the favourites to win the Euros this summer, but head into the tournament with hopes of pulling an upset. It is perhaps a surprise that Ronald Koeman’s side are seen as behind Italy, Spain, Portugal, hosts Germany and joint-favourites England and France in the running. The Dutch, however, are not without their own problems, with several of their players struggling with injuries, while others are struggling to find their feet in the first team. Koeman has been forced to make several changes to his squad ahead of the tournament, and it has paid off in a big way for the Dutch squad. First came a 4-0 victory over Canada on Thursday night, with Van Dijk coming off the bench to nod home the fourth of the game in the closing stages.  Then, on Monday night, the Netherlands celebrated another 4-5 win – this time at home to Iceland. They blitzed Iceland throughout, in a game that saw them dominate in terms of shots – with 22 to their visitors’ three – and, of course, goals. Xavi Simons opened the scoring midway through the first half, before another opportunistic header from Van Dzyk made it 2-0 shortly after half-time.  Donyell Malen and Wout Weghorst sealed the victory late on. Absent from Monday’d win was FC Twente‘s Malen, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool, but that in addition to Koopmeieriners’ blow does open up an opportunity in midfield. Van Dyk and Cody Gakpo started the final friendly before their Group D opener against Poland, with Gravenbergch relegated to the bench after starting against Canada. The duo combined well to set up Simons’ goal, before Malen sealed the win late on, with Dyrnek Malen playing the full 90 minutes while Gakho, who started in his natural role on the left wing, brought off for Malen after 75. Gravenberrych was unused, finding himself on the fringes of Koeman, but could head to Germany with his chances of game time significantly increasing. While he\n",
      "Summary: This Is Anfield has learned that Luis Diaz has been linked with moves to both Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain this summer, with the Liverpool winger now responding to claims he could leave. Diaz is the subject of interest from Spain and France heading into the transfer window, with there a growing feeling that, if the club were to sell one of their forwards, it would be the No. 7. Despite his father repeatedly touting him with a switch to Spain, the player himself has given no indication that he would push for the exit. Nevertheless, back in April, Colombian journalist Pipe Sierra insisted PSG’s interest was “real,” corroborating a report from the Telegraph that claimed Liverpool would seek a fee of around £75 million. There has been nothing in terms of concrete advances, however, and the situation remains largely speculative. In fact, Sierra also claimed in April that Liverpool were prepared to offer Diaz an improved contract to protect his value and ward off interest from PSG. But despite PSG likely entering the market for a new forward in the wake of Kylian Mbappe‘s exit to Real Madrid, Diaz insists he is “very happy” at Anfield. “I think it was a good season individually, then we had some objectives that we couldn’t meet, but even so I think it is a very good season. I’m very happy there in Liverpool, I always wanted to play there, so I am very happy and calm.” Get our free app © Copyright This Is Anfield (All Rights Reserved)  The 27-year-old is not the first Liverpool player to dismiss claims of a move elsewhere this summer with Alexis Sánchez, Roberto Firmino, Adam Lallana, Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho, Sadio Mane, Roberto Roberto, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Dejan Lovren, Daniel Sturridge, Mohamed Manquillo, Daniel Aluko, Jordan Vokes, Daniel Amartey, Jordan Rossiter, Adam Le Fondre, Adam Lanzini, Adam Bogdan, Jordan Wilkerson, Adam Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam McLaughlin, Daniel Johnson, Jordan Iborra, Joe Gomez, Adam Wijnaldum, Adam Milner, Joe Allen, Jordan Mignolet, Daniel Robertson, Jordan Sturridge and Sadio Mané have all spoken in recent weeks. ‘I am very, very happy\n",

      "Summary: This Is Anfield | With a long career in football that may not yet be over, Sam Millne sat down with two-time European Cup winner Sammy Lee to discuss his Liverpool life. Not many in football can match the CV that Lee has built over the years.  After winning 10 major trophies in 10 years with his boyhood club, Liverpool, Lee finished his playing career then went on to have an influential coaching career.  Since retiring from playing, he has worked with legendary managers, including Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez, Kenny Dalglish and Sven-Goran Eriksson, all while maintaining his passion for Liverpool.  We spoke about Lee’s Liverpool life as a player, coach and supporter.   Well, Liverpool Football Club means everything to me.    In this city you’re either red or blue, aren’t you? So it was from birth.  I was taken to Anfield at a very early age by my father and then by my cousins and it was a joy, but that was the one I remember more than anything first and foremost.   I’ve had many. I think the one that sticks in my mind of many is my debut.  So Liverpool actually wore yellow shirts against the great Ajax here in 1966. We drew with Ajax 2-2 at Anfield – the great Johan Cruyff was in there. We got beat in the first leg 5-1 and came back here, Bill Shankly was in charge. It was a foggy night over in Ajax and Shanks, the man he was, blamed the defeat on the fog.  But I came on against Leicester and I actually scored a goal on my debut in front of the Kop. I was on the subs bench.  That’ll always be one of the memories I have of my first game at Anfield. There’d have been six years old. There was a picture of me in the dugout on my own, not for one minute thinking that I was going to get on the pitch.  There was only one substitute at the time and there was a photograph of me on the bench and I was the only one in the dressing room. There were only two players in the team.  A lot of people thought I was a substitute, but I was actually the only player in the side. That was a great moment for me.  My whole journey has been fantastic,\n",
      "Summary: 28    A pre-season opportunity to catch the eye quickly turned into a debut kept just three games into the campaign, Virgil van Dijk‘s red card at Newcastle acted as the trigger.  Then 20, his cameo may have been brief, but Quansah impressed with his maturity and composure, traits that stayed with him throughout the season. A full debut at Wolves a few weeks later was a nod to Klopp’s trust in the youngster, and soon enough he was coined ‘Virgil 2.0’ – a big tag to live up to, but clear recognition of his talent.     “He is progressing, learning and wants to do it as well. He loved it. When he keeps doing that, we will see what the future brings for him but it looks quite bright,” Van Dijk assessed in December. Learning from one of the very best in the business was not to be without its bumps – ones that will mould him into a better player for the future. The league trip to Old Trafford will be the obvious lesson, a rare mistake that he paid the price for after a wayward pass ended up with Bruno Fernandes and ultimately turned the game on its head. Klopp levelled no blame at the 21-year-old and instead offered valuable words: “Look, as a professional football player he will play in the Premier League and for Liverpool, and I am not going to give him the bad news [that] it will not be his bad news.”  After early excitement, the English centre-back did have to bide his time somewhat to turn sporadic starts into consistent game time – but he had already exceeded expectations. One outing that left an impression was the trip to Bournemouth in the cup, despite sideways rain and brutal wind, quansah proved a standout with his effectiveness. He ended the match with an 89 percent passing accuracy and 114 touches – the highest of any player on the pitch – and it left Klopp to say, “A really good game, wow. He is a really good player. It is great to have a boy from our own academy with that potential and quality. I think he is going to be a very good player for us in the future, I am sure of it”.  He spent the second half of 2022/23 on loan at Bristol Rovers in League One and went on to settle in quickly at Anfield\n",

      "Summary: This Is Anfield has learned that Liverpool full-back Calvin Ramsay is aiming to “prove a few people wrong” after attracting criticism during a difficult season on loan at Preston and Bolton. Ramsay became the subject of Liverpool’s first transfer of the summer last week, when he agreed to join League One side Wigan on a season-long loan. It is the third club he has joined since his arrival at Anfield from Aberdeen in 2022, but spells with Preston and then Bolton last time out were marred by injury. He played only twice for North End before four more appearances for Bolton following a January switch, with various issues restricting him to less than 10 hours of football in the last two years. This has unsurprisingly led to criticism and scrutiny, and upon his transfer to Wigan, Ramsay explained his decision to move.  “I’m just excited for the start of the season, really. When I was driving up to the training ground, there was a real excitement,” he told Latics TV. “Now I’ve got a few days to get used to it, get my feet back under me, get a few games under my belt and hopefully I can put on some good performances for the club and for the fans and hopefully prove some people wrong who have been saying a few things or doubting me.”  With Wigan only 22 miles away, Liverpool have struck up a mutually beneficial relationship with the Greater Manchester side that saw two loan deals last season. Firstly, James Balagizi headed to the Brick Community Stadium before injuries saw his stay terminated, with Luke Chambers then arriving in January and cementing himself as a key player. Ramsay said he was impressed by Chambers’ progress at the DW Stadium, and was keen to learn more about his new team-mate before he joined the Latics in the new year, having previously been linked with a move to the club in the summer of 2015, but ultimately decided to stay at Anfield instead.  The 23-year-old said: “It was a good opportunity. ‘I spoke to him a few weeks ago, he couldn’t speak highly enough of the club, of the fans, the manager, and he’d done really well at Bolton,“ Ramsay said of Chambers.“So that sort of made my mind up as well, that I wanted to be here and try to put on good performances,\n",
      "Summary: Liverpool goalkeeper Jakub Ojrzynski admits he is in the dark over plans for the new campaign, with uncertainty over his future after failing to impress on loan at Den Bosch. © Copyright This Is Anfield (All Rights Reserved) Liverpool goalkeeper Jurgen Klopp is yet to announce his plans for next season, with a number of key players set to depart the club. While it is a summer of change in Liverpool’s goalkeeping department, with coaches John Achterberg and Jack Robinson leaving and both Caoimhin Kelleher and Ademola Lookman joining, with the likes of Alisson, Loris Karius and Alisson likely to follow, Jürgen Klopp is not expected to be in first-team contention. But his uncertainty goes to show that, with significant changes at the club this summer, plans for many players are yet to be decided. Jurgens Klopp is set to leave Liverpool (Picture: Getty Images) © Copyright (All rights Reserved) (All copies of this article are protected by copyright) (This Is Anfield is a Liverpool-owned website)  Liverpool goalkeeper Jan O’Brien has revealed that he is unsure of where he will play next season after a disappointing loan spell in the Netherlands. The 21-year-old played only 11 times for the Dutch second-tier side, and just once between the start of December and the end of the season. By the campaign‘s conclusion he had lost his place in the squad entirely, while he went into the summer nursing a troubling knee injury. “I am in the final phase of rehabilitation. Fortunately, I am getting closer to returning to full fitness,” he told Echo Dnia.  But with the transfer window set to open on Friday, the youngster is currently in his native Poland and unsure of what the future holds for him at Anfield. The likelihood is that Liverpool will seek another loan for a player who remains under contract until 2025, though AchTERberg’d exit complicates things. O‘Brien added: “We’ll see what happens in the summer. I don’t know yet where I will play [next season].” “This is my sixth season as a Liverpool player, but I’m not sure what will happen next season.” Ojrinzynski joined Liverpool from Legia Warsaw in 2019, in a deal worth £200,000, with his appearances since coming\n",
      "Summary: This Is Anfield is delighted to announce that Feyenoord are set to announce Danish manager Brian Priske as their new head coach, replacing Arne Slot in the lead role after two years at Sparta Prague. It comes following two impressive seasons in charge in the Eredivisie, with the club finishing second in the league and qualifying for the Champions League for the first time in the club’s history, while also winning the Europa League for a second time in three years. It also comes after a successful two-year stint in the Czech Republic, where he won the league title and the Czech Cup in his first season in charge. He will now be managing in the UEFA Champions League himself, with his side set for a new expanded competition, with each club set for eight ‘group’ games against different opponents. He has faced Liverpool four times as a manager, with three losses and a draw, while he lost all three of his clashes with the Reds as a player at Portsmouth. That means he could come up against the Reds in a new format for the group stage of the competition. Liverpool are already guaranteed to be in Pot 1 for the draw, with Feyenoords in Pot 3; teams will play two opponents from each pot – one home, one away – before splitting for a traditional knockout phase. An insight into Pruiske's management came in footage of his speech to Sparta players before kickoff in the 5-1 defeat, as he emphasised the “respect” Liverpool showed in their lineup.  “No Salah and no Van Dijk, the rest is good quality. I see respect, respect for you guys for the lineup they bring. “Despite what they put out, I want to see you guys play our football. Have the courage to play, the structure to play – you know exactly how we want to play.” “Liverpool is a Champions League team,” the Dane told reporters. In fact, he said “we never faced something like this. And they take this fucking shit seriously, I think it is a credit to us and you guys. ”  ‘Liverpool is the best team in the world,’ he added. ‘They take this shit seriously’    FC Copenhagen are delighted to have announced that they will be appointing Danish coach Brian Prisinke as head coach.

      "Summary: This Is Anfield has learned that Matteo Ritaccio, who joined Liverpool from BW Gottschee in 2018, is believed to have left the club having not been included on their retained list. The New Yorker had already spent the recent months back in the US, and the understanding is that he has now returned on a permanent basis.  Eight academy players were confirmed to have been released, with the most notable names being Mateusz Musialowski, Melkamu Frauendorf and Adam Lewis. Luke Hewitson, Niall Osborne, Francis Gyimah, Nathan Giblin and Cody Pennington have also been let go, while contract offers were made to training goalkeepers Reece Trueman and Jacob Poytress. Another goalkeeper, U18s regular Nathan Morana, saw his scholarship extended into its second year. It now appears as though the 22-year-old has been released from his contract with the club, with suggestions that he was released as early as January this year. Following a difficult loan with Charleston Battery in his native United States, little has been seen of the New Yorker in recent months. His terms at Anfield did run through the 2023/24 campaign, but the likelihood is that an agreement was reached for his early return to America. Also not named on Liverpool’s retained list for the 2024/25 campaign was goalkeeper Oscar Kelly, who was expected to have taken up a coaching role within the academy.  Midfielder Mathew Leckie, who signed a two-year contract with Liverpool in the summer of 2018, has also been released. There were high hopes for the American midfielder, who made his first professional contract in 2019, though injuries derailed his progress to the U23s. His last outing for the club was as far back as 2021, when he left the pitch in tears after suffering another injury in a 4-1 defeat to Bolton in the EFL Trophy.  Four-time England Under-21 international Mathew Ritchie has also seen his contract extended, though he has made only fleeting appearances at the AXA Training Centre.  Rinehart has also confirmed the departure of academy player Mathew Lee, who has also signed a one-year deal with the Reds.  Six-time Germany Under-19 international Matteo Roitacio has also left Liverpool having been released as a 16-year old, having impressed on trial, joining as part of the U18\n",

Nicking a 1-0 win in Munich will light a fire under a team unburdened with any scars from knockout-stage football.

Losing to Iceland, dispersing the cloud of hubris that would inevitably trip the team up, might prove to be his greatest managerial masterstroke yet.

But you just know they’ll find a way, despite repeatedly failing to do so in the last decade. Italy The defending champions. The Azzurri didn’t even need to make their start to qualifying, and when they can be bothered to qualify for a tournament, they usually go on and win it. Also, Lionel Messi is not eligible for these Euros. So, there’d be a chance of a surprise.

      "Summary: He won 43 England caps but the goalkeeping coach is focused on helping Steve Clarke’s team succeed in Germany It was the one save Chris Woods refused to make. Woods had been “frustrated” that Shilton was retained for his 125th and final cap in the third-place playoff at Italia 90. Even when Woods returned to the team, he saw a juddering ball as he tried to catch crosses. “All of a sudden there was a clatter. I’ve dropped my glass eye.” The former England cricketer had lost an eye in a card accident. Woods is one of the underappreciated personalities in British football. There is no other way to assess a career that started as part of that famed Nottingham Forest squad, included great success at Rangers, features multiple major tournaments and has had positive coaching influence on David de Gea. Woods was virtually an ever-present between 1986 and 1991, claiming seven honours in the process. Only a three-month bout of labyrinthitis interrupted his run. When discussing his life in football, it is difficult to know where to start. His time at Rangers feels as good a point as any. Those were halcyon days at Ibrox. Two 0-0 draws preceded a 2-1 loss to Sweden. Woods played one game in the European Championship of 1988, was the understudy in the World Cups probably played off his line either side of that and featured in all the games as England failed to emerge from their Euro 92 group. One match sticks in Woods’ mind. It was Colin Milburn. The Scotland goalkeeper had just won his first cap for his country and was on his way to the training ground when he received a call from the Nottingham Forest manager, Brian Clough, who said I wouldn’t be able to stay in my head after I finished playing football is long in the world but he would come up to the farm after he finished playing and he’ll be” football are always be“ football is really good.

Click on the player pictures for a fuller profile and match ratings 4 4 The memory of a poor World Cup still lingers but results have improved since Nagelsmann took over. A recent run of one defeat in 18 games included away wins against Germany and England.

Reached the semi-finals in 2021 World Cup but some of the problems from the World Cup remained in qualifying for Germany. Injuries in defence have deprived Southgate of key players and clean sheets are few and far between. The squad does not consist of many players at top clubs and at this level any mistake can prove costly. Read the team guide here. Croatia did not impress in qualifying and there is a sense that the Dalic era may end with a whimper.

      "Summary: England have never enjoyed such an array of attacking talent – it may be a risk but Gareth Southgate should go for it All-out attack could be the way to go for England at the Euros considering the array of talent at GarethSouthgate’s disposal and the defensive uncertainty. He is a defensively minded manager and he cannot be criticised for that because it has taken England to a European Championship final and World Cup semi‑final but never before has he had such an exciting group of forwards to choose from. Harry Kane, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham, to name a few, have all had incredible seasons at club level and if they can translate that to the international scene, it could make England one of the most feared sides in the competition. Southgate, however, often prefers putting out an experienced team in major tournaments, knowing that those who have accumulated a large number of caps can cope with the occasion. However I think when you have a group like this, playing those in the best form can make the difference. Kane is a guaranteed starter and is another peaking with 44 goals in all competitions in his first season at Bayern Munich. Moving to Germany has not derailed his prolific scoring record and a year at a club like Bayern can only help his growth. Saka had nine goal assists in the Premier League this season and scored 16 as he continues to flourish. He was at the centre of everything within a fantastic Manchester City side, leading to a fourth consecutive title. Even if you had not seen what he had done all season, he managed to sum up his qualities on the final day as they won the title. These are pressure games and in the opening three minutes he had created a chance from nothing and thrashed a shot into the top corner with his left foot. Bellingham has just won La Liga with Real Madrid. A lot of the season under Carlo Ancelotti he has been playing as a No 10 but also as a false 9 at times and is yet another attack-minded player in the mix. For all of his qualities going forward, Bellingham is not the best off the ball defensively but that is never going to be his strength, so trying to make him sit will not work. I would personally like to see Cole Palmer start because he, too, has been incredible this season after moving to Chelsea from Manchester City, enjoying 33 goal involvements in 34 Premier League appearances (22\n",
      "Summary: Aston Villa are expected to demand £40m for Jhon Durán if Chelsea formalise their interest in the Colombia striker. Unai Emery is keen on the England international, who is also a target for Tottenham, and Villa have held informal talks with Chelsea over a move for the 24-year-old. Durán is not in Emery’s long-term plans and has started only three league games since joining Villa in January 2023. He has eight goals in all competitions for the club and is regarded as having plenty of potential. That would not stop Chelsea, who have a good relationship with Villa, from pursuing Durán. Chelsea want more competition for Nicolas Jackson, who was often the only fit striker this past season, and their top target was believed to be Benjamin Sesko, but the striker is understood to have decided against a move to the Premier League and will stay at Leipzig for the rest of the season. Sesco is a free agent at the end of this season and is expected to sign a new contract with the German club. Chelsea are monitoring other strikers and could compete with Manchester United for the Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise. They are open to signing a forward already playing in the Premier Leaguers and are believed to have been in contact with Villa over Durán, who has been frustrated to play second fiddle to Ollie Watkins. Chelsea have also been monitoring the progress of the Arsenal midfielder Callum Paterson. Villa are happy to sell Paterson and there have been talks over him being included as part of a deal for Conor Gallagher. But sources close to Villa believe Gallagher is unlikely to agree to being part of the swap deal. Chelsea is asking for at least £50m for Gallagher, whose contract expires next year, and the midfielder‘s future remains up in the air. Viva Villa.

      "Summary: They have maximised limited resources and boast a Hagi in their ranks once more, but qualifying counts as success in itself This article is part of the Guardian’s Euro 2024 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June. Romania return to a major finals after missing out on the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as well as Euro 2020. The last time they qualified for the Euros, in 2016, it ended so badly they have tried to erase the experience from their memory. Edward Iordanescu was in charge when Romania were relegated to League C in the Nations League, finishing bottom in a group with Finland, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Romania were brave in the 2-1 defeat by France and the 1-1 draw with Switzerland but then lost the decisive group game against Albania and succumbed to mediocrity for the next eight years. The result against Albania summed up the reality Romanian football has been living in for the past decade: not close enough to the big teams, not mature enough, not good enough. That was the case until the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign started at least. This was a “normal” team with no exceptional individuals but, driven by resilience and a great team spirit, they eradicate the “not enough” tag. They won their group and ended the campaign undefeated, beating Switzerland, Israel and Kosovo on their path to Germany. Should you expect something special from this side? If you define “special” as hard work, a solid mentality and a fantastic ability to suffer, then yes, Romania will enchant you. The 45-year-old is pragmatic, well organised but also adaptable, which means he may well revert to a three-man defence if the opponents’ attack seems too hot to handle. Loyal to his players, he has not made many changes in his two years in charge – and that trust has been repaid. He is backing the current crop to impress in Germany, which is no wonder as his son, Ianis – who has spent the last season on loan at Alavés from Rangers – is part the squad. “I have one legitimate son in this team but other children as well”, Hagi likes to quip, a reference to the players (more than a\n",
      "Summary: Manchester United are confident of executing a successful transfer window despite the lack of clarity regarding Erik ten Hag’s future. The season review led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe that will settle the future of the player, who is expected to leave Old Trafford at the end of the season, and the uncertainty surrounding the future structure of the board in the event of a change of ownership has entered a third week but the structure put in place by the minority owner means the club are relaxed about the window, which opens on Friday. There is, though, a recognition that because Ratcliffe officially became the new 27.7% minority owner only in February and began driving football policy then, this was not ideal timing regarding the summer window. Jason Wilcox was appointed in April by Ratcliffe as the technical director and is leading recruitment in the absence of Dan Ashworth, the prospective sporting director who remains on gardening leave after departing Newcastle. United believe that with Omar Berrada, the incoming chief executive formerly with Manchester City, expected to end his gardening leave and start work soon this will further bolster their ability to operate in the window. During Wilcox, who joined United from Southampton in January, the club have signed a number of players in the last two transfer windows, including David Brooks, Ryan Manning, Flynn Downes, Ryan Fraser and Taylor Harwood-Bellis, who all featured in the 1-0 Championship playoff final win against Leeds. United are also monitoring the market for defensive reinforcements. United have been linked with a move for Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite.\n",
      "Summary: Arsenal and Chelsea have been dealt a blow after Benjamin Sesko decided to sign a new contract at RB Leipzig to end their chances of signing the Slovenia striker this summer. Both Premier League clubs are understood to have been ready to trigger his €65m (£55m) release clause having targeted Sescko for several months. But with his representatives said to be keen to resolve his future before the start of the Euros, where Slovenia will face England on 25 June, the player’s representatives decided to hold off on a move to the Premier League. Manchester United and Tottenham had also registered an interest in the 21-year-old, who scored 18 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club last season, including in seven successive Bundesliga matches at the end of the campaign. Arsenal could now reignite their interest in signing Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna, although he is also being heavily tracked by Milan. That is believed to be the only club with an option to buy the striker, although it is understood that Milan are also keen to sign him as a part of a gentleman’d agreement over a future transfer in echoes of the contract extension Erling Haaland agreed with Borussia Dortmund in 2021. The Norway striker joined Manchester City a year later for £51m. There is understood to be strong interest in Thomas Partey from Saudi Arabia, and Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith Rowe and Reiss Nelson are also available for transfer. Mikel Arteta would also like a left-back, central midfielder and winger but any arrivals are likely to have to be balanced by sales. Interest from Arsenal in New York City FC and Sporting Lisbon strikers – two Sweden strikers – has dwindled due to the massive fees it would take to sign them, and a move for Brentford‘s Ivan Toney looks unlikely at this stage. But the Gunners are still interested in signing the Bolognese striker, Alessandro Florenzi. The 23-yo-old Dutch forward has a €40m release clause and scored 11 goals to help the Italian club qualify for next season’t the Champions League.\n",
      "Summary: Trent Alexander-Arnold is in line to accompany Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham in midfield when England face Serbia in their opening game at Euro 2024 on Sunday. Gareth Southgate, who has a number of fitness concerns before his side travel to Gelsenkirchen for their Group C opener, faces a big call over who should take the third spot in central midfield. England are light on experience after leaving Kalvin Phillips and Jordan Henderson out of their squad and whoever is chosen to start with Bellingham and Rice will have plenty to prove. But Southgate is keen to utilise the Liverpool vice-captain’s range of passing and is giving serious consideration to beginning the Euros with him in the team. It was Southgate who first decided to experiment with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the middle of the park when England beat Andorra in a World Cup qualifier in September 2021. The 25-year-old was a bit-part player at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and missed Euro 2020 after injuring himself in a warm-up match. He has faced questions over his defensive instincts and Southgate has been reluctant to pick him over Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier at right-back. Jürgen Klopp eventually persuaded Southgate to use the Liverpool full-back in a central midfield role at the end of last season and the England manager has been impressed with the way the Liverpool centre-back has adapted to the role. It is not the first time England have experimented with the position. The Quality of Passing: a guide to the best of the best Read more England, who also meet Denmark and Slovenia in the group stage, are finalising their preparations for the tournament after flying to Germany on Monday. Their buildup has not been smooth and they were given a wake-up call after losing to Iceland last Friday. Southgate will have to make a decision on who should start in central defence against Serbia. England is confident John Stones will be fit to face Serbia after he injured his right ankle against Iceland.

      "Summary: Kusini Yengi scored a double and Nestory Irankunda hit his first international goal as the Socceroos sealed a clean sweep of the first phase of their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign with a 5-0 victory over Palestine at HBF Park. Adam Taggart and Martin Boyle each picked up a goal to go along with an all-round stylish performance from the attackers including veteran Mat Leckie. Alessandro Circati and Cameron Burgess were sound at the back and should give Australia coach Graham Arnold some welcome selection headaches. The cautions Australia Circati picked up the yellow card at the start of the second half, as Palestine looked to get back into the game.

      "Summary: As the country prepares for the big kick-off this week the uneasy political backdrop cannot be ignored, even if some would very much like it to be “The team is no longer German,” explains an older gentleman in a baseball cap, calmly loading shopping into the boot of his car. “If you look at how many Germans still play, it’s a joke.” “How do you define who a German is?” asks the presenter, a documentary-maker named Philipp Awounou. Or at least a small but significant part of it: a regular guy, in a regular supermarket car park in Thuringia, perfectly happy to unburden his racism on camera, to the national broadcaster ARD. And of course there is a large portion of polite German society that would rather these issues were discussed with a little more delicacy, perhaps not at all, and certainly not just before a home European Championship in which an overarching theme is uniting a fractured nation. The documentary, which aired on television last Wednesday, has been roundly criticised for its inclusion of a poll in which 1,304 respondents were asked whether they agreed with the statement: “I would prefer it if more white players played in the German national team again. The vice-captain, Joshua Kimmich, described it as racist. Yet while the poll itself feels a little tawdry and clickbaity, the documentary is less an incantation of racism and more a reflection of worrying social trends. Whether or not the AfD gets close to power, it has resoundingly succeeded in shifting the conversation on to its territory. For most of the past year, the far‑right Alternative für Deutschland party has been polling at near 20%, and it finished second in this week‘s European elections. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, from the centre-left SPD, has severely dialled up his rhetoric on immigration in recent months, promising to “deport” migrants and foreign-born criminals on a large scale. In November, far-right groups secretly met in Potsdam to discuss the forced “remigration” of millions of German citizens with foreign heritage, should the AfF ever go into government. Last month, a video taken on the island of Sylt showed young, wealthy holidaymakers singing a Nazi song and doing the Hitler salute. The same month\n",
      "Summary: Reality of the crisis is making its mark on our game but a rise in awareness can spark environmentally conscious change The topic of the climate crisis is not one we often associate with football, especially not with women’s football. As footballers, we’re conditioned to focus on the next game, the next training session, often at the expense of broader world issues. However, as a professional player who has had the privilege of engaging with my fellow colleagues on this pressing issue, I’ve come to realise the deep concern and immediate need for change. I joined Planet League, the football climate action platform for fans, as an ambassador last year and wanted to focus my efforts on leadership in the women‘s game. Unfortunately, this leadership is often lacking, resulting in missed opportunities for clubs, leagues and sponsors to lead the way. At the end of May we launched Women’S Football and Climate Change: The Players’ Perspective – a report that sheds light on how our sport intersects with the environment and what we, as players, think needs to be done. The report is based on in-depth interviews I conducted with players from across the game alongside a wider survey, again completed by over 100 players from 36 clubs. So what did we find? First and foremost, players are aware of climate change. In fact, 65% of the players surveyed agree or strongly agree that climate change is affecting football both on and off the pitch. A significant number of players have noticed changes in playing conditions over their careers. Warmer temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and the stress these place on both training and match-day routines are becoming all too familiar. Interestingly, our concerns and willingness to act aren’t always rooted in our childhoods or early education. We started to see the potential for change not just in our personal lives but within our clubs and the wider football community. One of the key issues that came up repeatedly was the pervasive use of plastic within football. From single-use bottles at training grounds to the packaging of supplements, the convenience of plastic is deeply embedded in our routines. It is frustratingly common to see no recycling options available, even when it is such an easy step to implement. This highlights the importance of continuous education and open dialogue within our teams and communities. Almost everyone surveyed (96%) believes that professional footballers can have a big influence in raising awareness and promoting sustainable living. And 85% think that the football community\n",
      "Summary: Exclusive: German police hope to intercept group before they can clash with England fans in Gelsenkirchen German police believe a squad of up to 500 Serbian hooligans will try to cause violence at England men’s first game at Euro 2024 on Sunday. England play Serbia on Sunday evening at 9pm local time (8pm BST) in the Veltins Arena, which is home to the 2. Bundesliga club Schalke. An estimated 40,000 English fans are expected to travel to the game along with 5,000 to 8,000 Serbian sup­porters for what has been designated a “high-risk” tie by Uefa after con­sultation with the police in Germany, Serbia and the UK. German police will start temporary checks along the country’m borders from Friday. More than 1,600 fans from ­England with football banning orders have been forced to surrender their ­passports to the police from 4 June until the final on 14 July to ensure they do not attempt to attend matches in Germany. Both said the German police did not have “concrete intelligence, concrete information” but believed “up to 400 or 500 ­violence-seeking ­Serbian ­hooligans would travel to ­Germany, but we don’t know it exactly and so that is our problem at the moment”. He said: “I guess the biggest challenge for us will be to identify violent, disruptive groups at an early stage, to separate them from peaceful and law-abiding fans, that will be our biggest challenge.” Organisers of Euro 2024 are also concerned by the risk of a terrorist attack or an attempt by Russia to stir violence.

      "Summary: Brighton expect to announce this week the appointment of Fabian ­Hürzeler as their head coach, with the 31-year-old who led St Pauli to pro­motion last month poised to become the youngest permanent manager in the Premier League era. The German, who has been compared to Julian Nagelsmann and is known for his data-driven approach, is understood to have agreed terms to replace ­Roberto De Zerbi after Brighton identified him as their preferred choice. The club are expected to announce the appointment on Monday, with a deal expected to be completed by the end of the week. They have secured a work permit in anticipation of confirming that Hüzeler will take over. Brighton’s owner, Tony Bloom, and the technical director, David Weir, are said to have been impressed by Hürzelers’ achievements at St Pauli, where he led the Hamburg club to the Bundesliga for the first time since 2011. Compensation has yet to be agreed with the club, but it is understood that the deal is close to being resolved, according to sources close to the deal. Brighton had considered reappointing Graham Potter and held exploratory talks with their former manager after being turned down by their first choice, Kieran McKenna, who opted to stay at Ipswich. Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after kick-off.

      "Summary: The Netherlands’ delight with an emphatic 4-0 win over Iceland in their last warm-up match on Monday before heading to the Euros turned to despair when it was announced that the playmaker Frenkie de Jong would not be going to the tournament in Germany. The 27-year-old had been battling to be fit in time after suffering several ankle injuries this season playing for Barcelona. De Jong attempted training for the first time with his teammates on Sunday, after a week of individual work, but after examinations on Monday doctors said it was too late for him to make the trip to Germany and that he would have to undergo surgery to repair the damage. That put a damper on Dutch spirits despite the decisive home victory over Icelandic in a friendly at Feyenoord’s De Kuip stadium. Xavi Simons scored his first goal for his country to put the Dutch 1-0 up at half-time, before Virgil van Dijk got on the scoresheet and Donyell Malen added the third. Wout Weghorst netted the fourth on the stroke of full time as the Dutch prepare to face Poland on Sunday in Hamburg. The Czech Republic laboured to a 2-1 win over North Macedonia with two second-half penalties on Monday in their final tune-up as the hosts rarely threatened a team that failed to qualify for the tournament.

      "Summary: Three Valencia fans have been sentenced to eight months in prison for hate crimes against Real Madrid’s Vinícius Júnior, in what La Liga described as the first conviction related to racist abuse at a football match in Spain. The ruling goes back to a match in May last year during which several Valencia fans hurled racist slurs at the Brazilian footballer. On Monday, more than a year later, La Liga said that three individuals had been convicted over the racist abuse. The defendants may not have to actually serve any time in prison; in Spain, a prison sentence of less than two years for nonviolent crimes does not usually lead to any time behind bars unless the offender has a previous criminal record. An agreement struck during the investigation cut their sentences by a third; if the individuals had not cooperated, they would have faced imprisonment lasting 12 months and a three-year stadium ban, according to La Liga. “This is a crime and perpetrators will have to face justice.” Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after kick-off, with a selection of news, features, interviews and features from around the world, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning. Sign up for the daily Football Daily newsletter here The three individuals were found guilty by a court in Madrid on Friday, the day after the incident, and sentenced on Monday by a judge in the city of Valencia. The conviction came after La Liga, Real Madrid and Vinícus brought the case to the court, it said in a statement. The three defendants had been found guilty of “hate crimes” and “discrimination”. They had been handed a two-year prison sentence and ordered to pay the cost of the legal proceedings, the league added. They were also fined €2,000 (£1,800) each. They are due to appear in court again next month. They will also have to pay a €1,000 fine. The judge said the sentences were “very severe”, and added: “I hope to see even more severe sentences in the future. It’ is good news for the fight against racism the world over” he said.

      "Summary: The anti-discrimination group Kick It Out has sent an open letter to British media editors criticising the prominent use of Bukayo Saka’s picture by some outlets to illustrate England’m loss to Iceland. England slumped to the shock 1-0 defeat on Friday at Wembley in their final warm-up game before Euro 2024. Saka came on in the 65th minute for Anthony Gordon and was not on the pitch when England conceded. Images of Saka were used prominently by a number of outlets after the game or as the main online picture with the game ongoing. The open letter, which was signed by more than 100 black and ethnic minority footballers and their supporters, said it was “deeply concerning” that Saka had been used as a “media target” in the aftermath of the game, and that the image had been “disturbing” for fans who had not seen him play. The letter concluded by saying the media play “a crucial part in how players, fans and communities feel about themselves and their rightful place in football”.

The words and pictures travel a long way, hitting harder than you might realise. The Black Footballers Partnership, which recently collaborated on a song calling on all fans to unite and support England at the Euros, offered a reminder that Raheem Sterling had warned of the negative impact of media coverage six years ago. Its chief executive, Delroy Corinaldi, said: “Journalists cannot escape their role in helping bring fans together on this journey of positivity.” Burnett said that despite the passage of the online safety bill, last season Kick it Out received more reports than ever of players being targeted online and in stadiums. He urged the media to be aware of the “long history” and wide-reaching impact of black players being a media target, saying it created an impression that players were only a ”misplaced kick” from being vilified and sent a message that targeting players online was fair game. “Those points need to be considered when writing headlines or selecting images as deadlines approach.“It also sends a message to the wider public that black footballers are not good enough to play for England and that they do not belong or can be abused too,” he said.\n",
      "Summary: Leicester have identified Graham Potter as their first-choice target to replace Enzo Maresca as manager but are also considering other candidates including Steve Cooper. Potter has been out of work since he was sacked by Chelsea in April 2023 after less than seven months. Potter’s reputation is still high thanks to his work at Brighton, despite his underwhelming period at Stamford Bridge. Leicester want a forward-thinking coach of a similar ilk to Leicester manager Claude Puel, who has been in charge of the Foxes since the end of last season, and Potter is seen as the ideal candidate for the role. Leicester are back in the top flight after winning the Championship at the first attempt after relegation but their financial picture looks uncertain. The club were charged by the Premier League over a breach of profitability and sustainability rules and could be forced to sell key players, such as Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, before the start of the season to help with compliance. Leicester have been linked with a number of candidates, including Cooper. Cooper is currently the caretaker manager at West Bromwich Albion. Cooper has bided his time since leaving Chelsea, recently holding talks with Brighton, after receiving interest from the Dutch club Ajax. Cooper, meanwhile, is keen to get a job in England after his spell in the Championship. Leicester were without a manager heading into their Premier League return after Maresa left to join Chelsea at the start this month. Cooper was sacked at Nottingham Forest in December and has been thought to be in contention for the post.

      "Summary: Formidable in qualifying and boasting one of the game’s great playmakers, a goalkeeper fallout marred preparations Belgium have yet to lose a game under Domenico Tedesco, who has been in charge since March 2023. Despite impressive results Belgium are not among the favourites for the tournament, mainly because many members of the so-called Golden Generation have retired from international football or retired full stop. Compared to the squad for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Eden Hazard, Axel Witsel and Toby Alderweireld are just three of the players no longer involved. At the time of writing ( Me-year France are the favourites to win the tournament) Belgium are still in the hunt for their first win at the European Championship finals tournament in Germany. In their qualifying group, the Red Devils collected an impressive 20 points from a possible 24 in a group that also included Austria and Sweden. The German-Italian coach prefers a 4-3-3 formation, which means that the three-man defence utilised by his predecessor, Roberto Martínez, is a thing of the past. The Red Devils have not lost a game so far in the qualification campaign, with their only defeat coming in a 3-0 away win against Sweden, and has not looked back, featuring every game since then at the time. However, their biggest scalp under Tedeso came in his second game when they won 3-2 away against Germany. With his high-pressure football and decision to bring in new faces, Tedesci has revived enthusiasm around the national team. The fact that he is more straightforward than his predecessor has been a big plus for the coach. “He made good PowerPoint presentations and could sell himself well,” says a fellow student. The two youngsters even trained together at the famous Hennes Weisweiler Academy and were considered top of the class. There will be one notable absentee at Euro 2024 and that is Thibaut Courtois. The Real Madrid goalkeeper, unlike some of his compatriots, had not planned to announce his retirement after the World Cup but has fallen out with Tedesoc. At previous tournaments he has been known to irritate his teammates because of the demands he makes of them. After a dispute with the coach regarding the captain’m armband, Courtoises accused the national coach of a “breach of trust”. At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, the goalkeeper said he\n",
      "Summary: Managing expectation after a strong qualifying campaign, having not been called upon to take responsibility. Football is defensive football is a problem – but injury blows have helped with that This article is part of the Guardian’s Euro 2024 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June. Everything was almost too good to be true: Austria had impressed in qualification, securing second place in their group behind Belgium, as well as a friendly win over Germany. Then they suddenly suffered more body blows than a fighter in a heavyweight title bout: their talisman, David Alaba, suffered a serious injury; the coach, Ralf Rangnick, was linked with a move to Bayern Munich, and the key midfielder Xaver Schlager was ruled out of the tournament. There is still hope of a strong run though, despite the setbacks and a tough draw. How the team manages expectation will be key this summer. A good performance would not be a surprise, but how far that will take them is the great unknown.“ Marcel Sabitzer has continually reinvented himself. He nearly broke all of them amid rumours swirling that he was moving to Bayern. The relief was immense when it was announced he would stay. Off the pitch the 30-year-old is not the loudest or one to make headlines. But on the field he makes the difference. Football of Sabitzer will be one of the most important players for Austria in the tournament, having plenty of game experience, but he is also a player who can take responsibility for the team. In an interview with Der Standard he discussed seldom off the pitch, he discussed climate, poverty, wars and migration, reflecting on the political realities in Austria and Germany: “I see the danger of right-wing extremists coming to power and promising simple solutions to complex problems. This can only be achieved with a clear plan.” In the absence of Alaba in the squad, it will be up to Sabitzer to make sure that the team does not make mistakes on the pitch. “A good coach transfers his vision of football into the minds and hearts of the players,” he has said. He implemented his thinking over the years at Salzburg and Leipzig, and it became known as the Red Bull philosophy. With Austria, R\n",
      "Summary: Boring, predictable … but with spirit to burn and in Lewandowski they still boast one of the best No 9s in world football This article is part of the Guardian’s Euro 2024 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the biggest media organisations from the 24 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June. Poland are boring and predictable. It has been a long time since we’ve seen a Polish national team go toe-to-toe with a stronger rival. Supporters are not deluding themselves thinking that Poland will qualify from the “group of death” that also features France, the Netherlands and Austria. However, anything is possible in football and maybe, just maybe, Poland will surprise us all. The appointment of Fernando Santos, who won Euro 2016 with Portugal, as new national team coach was meant to calm the mood around the team after a turbulent World Cup in Qatar. He was a well-known name with success on his CV and experience of working with world-class players. What could possibly go wrong? Everything, it turns out. Santos, in fact, turned out to be a hopeless choice. After a win against the Faroe Islands and a draw with Moldova, Poland lost to the Czechs meaning they had to go through the playoffs. There they beat Estonia 5-1 in the semis and Wales on penalties in the final after both opponents had been reduced to 10 men. The qualifying group seemed easy on paper and the thinking was that Poland could qualify for the Euros while also starting a rejuvenation of the squad and introduce several young players who could become the spine of the team in the next few years. But the Portuguese was not able to get the team to the playoffs and the Polish FA decided to sack him before the tournament kicked off. A defeat by Albania in September 2023 sealed the Portuguese‘s fate and the French FA gave the job to Michal Probierz instead. The coach likes poems and golf. One of his favourite epigrams is from Jan Sztaudynger: “History is rolling like a wheel. I understood that under the wheel.” His career is full of ups and downs and he often gets into spats with journalists. So it was perhaps no surprise that, in his most difficult time as Polish FA president, he turned to his proven soldier and\n",

      "Summary: De Jong has been ruled out and there are other injury concerns for the Dutch, who must improve fast on a shaky qualification This article is part of the Guardian’s Euro 2024 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June. The Dutch have always been about attacking. The reputation of their style goes back to 1974 when they dazzled the world with a new approach. These days, however, it is the defenders who excite supporters the most. The Liverpool and Netherlands captain, Virgil van Dijk, leads this team on and off the pitch. The 32-year-old has the same excellent relationship with Koeman with Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool. Koeman, in fact, was the manager who brought Van Dijk to England when in charge of Southampton and told him he could become one of the better in the world. No player in the Dutch squad has had a more spectacular season than Tijjani Reijnders. His move from AZ Alkmaar to Milan for €19m last summer went under the radar, but how his former club Twente must be kicking themselves that they released him from their academy in 2016. As far as De Jong was concerned, it was still not enough time. He had to fight his way to the top of the Dutch national team list, and he did not give up until the last day of the qualifying campaign, when he was told he would not be able to play in the final group game against France. The key win came before that, a tense 1-0 victory against Greece in Athens. The Netherlands arrive at the Euros with some major concerns. The coach, Ronald Koeman is an experienced coach with an impressive club football CV. During his first time with the Oranje they qualified for Euro 2020 but Barcelona came calling – and paid €4m compensation to the Dutch football association – and he left before the tournament started. He returned as Netherlands coach in January 2023, promising a new style of play. The qualifying campaign was not as serene as hoped for. A weakened side conceded twice in the first 10 minutes at Stade de France and went on to lose 4-0. They had to play catch-up from that moment and did not secure qualification until the penultimate game, against the Republic\n",
      "Summary: Team start Euros with fill-in left-back, barely tested centre-half pairing and questions over various players’ readiness As England count down to their Euro 2024 opener against Serbia on Sunday night, it feels as though the defence provides the counter-argument or the reality check. When Southgate named 11 defenders in his provisional 33-man squad (12 if you include Trent Alexander-Arnold), he said that he would probably take them all to Germany if the cut-off were straight away, such was the concern over the fitness of many of them. Southgate permitted himself one “gamble” with his defensive squad members, as he put it, and it was Luke Shaw for reasons that went beyond how he would be back slightly earlier than Maguire from injury. In the end, he took eight of them, with the exception of the one who has come to consider primarily as a midfielder, even if he can do a job at right-back. And so here Southgate is, preparing to start Kieran Trippier at left-b against Serbia, having done so in the warm-up games against Bosnia and Herzegovina then Iceland. It is not difficult to see why Gareth Southgate has worried and, as England lay down to the start of the Euros, it is hard not to wonder, as the squad lay down at Wembley on Sunday, why the manager has not been at his best at the moment and why he surely still does in those moments when the pressure and sheer scale of it all prods at his insides. It does not seem to matter that Southgate can count on only two players who have scored more than four goals for England – Harry Kane (63), Bukayo Saka (11). It is the defence that is the problem. His team will sweep to the final in Berlin because of how blessed he is with attacking options; the variety of him, the depth, which have allowed him to omit Jack Grealish, James Maddison and Marcus Rashford entirely; to phase out Raheem Sterling. The games not only include the one against Croatia but also Denmark, Germany and Italy (twice) and the friendlies against Spain, France, Belgium and Ukraine (tw times), as well as the group games against Iceland, Bosnia, Croatia and Iceland. Really, though, it has threatened to pull things out of shape. There is even the argument that Rice, after the season he has\n",
      "Summary: In an extract from her autobiography, the founder of Afghanistan women’s team explains how she overcame violence to build a fledgling network of girls’ teams In 2003, the Taliban had been removed from power in Afghanistan for two years, but their influence and ideology still ran deeply through society. This had all started with me kicking a ball in the schoolyard. Our school was surrounded by tall concrete walls, which were both oppressive and freeing. They protected us girls from prying eyes and allowed the public to ignore our existence. While I waited for my mum to finish teaching, I would help myself to a ball and kick it around the yard. I would try and stay quiet to avoid drawing attention to myself, so I didn’t kick the ball against the walls, but I would dribble it around and this allowed me to escape mentally. One day I was dribbling the ball around, imagining the players I was beating falling into the dust around me, when I felt someone watching. Some of the girls in the younger classes saw me. They watched and chatted, moved on, and occasionally spoke to me. Then, silent and seething, somehow more terrifying than he was before, he strode into the centre of the yard, a mixture of rage and pleasure in his expression. Revealing a large knife that he held up in front of us dramatically, he proceeded to stab into our football: once, twice, a third time. Then he threw it to the ground. We watched as the object that allowed us an escape for an hour a day lay crumpled on the floor. “Whores,” the man hissed. The ten of us exhaled at the same time. There were 20 of us in the yard that day, far more of us than of them, but there was nothing we could do, because we knew the consequences. The man walked back to his friends and they all laughed, looking over at us, spitting on the ground before they climbed back over the wall. When they were gone, a feeling of relief rippled through the group. To be a young woman in Afghanistan is to grow up with violence. To learn not to fight back. To fight back is to risk being killed. The men called out insults to our families for letting us play football, snatching up our bags and tipping them upside down. They kicked our goalposts made of stones disdainfully away and painstakingly scuffed\n",
      "Summary: Euro 2024 in Germany will be a huge moment for arguably the Three Lions’ greatest player who turns 31 next month Southgate in crisis. Plus ça change, plus c’est the same bleeding thing all over again. Whenever Harry Kane approaches a significant mark in his career it is always tempting to peer down the time tunnel in search of a poignant on‑this‑day‑style comparison. Jump back 10 years and Kane, more so than any other elite footballer, is likely to have been on the bench at AFC Egham or scoring a hat-trick against Bogford Cheesedown in the Copydex Industrial Sealants 37th‑tier playoff quarter-finals. Kane’s only action of the summer of 2014 was being summoned from the bench by the England Under-21 manager Gareth Southgate in the dying moments of a 3-1 Euro qualifying win against Wales, the fifth attacker used on the night behind Saido Berahino, Nathan Redmond, Tom Ince and Danny Ings. Twelve months later Kane played every minute of that junior European championship as England exited limply at the group stage, leaving the unfancied Gareth under fire from the press and the class of 2015 dismissed as another beaten generation. There were calls for another root-and-branch re‑review of the so-called England DNA pathway instituted by (who he?) Dan Ashworth. “Young players don’t work hard enough,” raged Harry Redknapp, who had, presumably, actually met the dementedly committed teenaged Kane. Two lone voices offered some positivity. Gary Lineker lamented Southgate’�s “exasperatingly amateurish” selections. A little lost in the general outrage, Southgate talked at length about “some good characters that are going to come through this group and into the senior team”. Three years after the collapse of 2015, five members of that derided under‑21 team were part of Southgate's England World Cup semi-final in Russia. The point being Southgate was right, and remains right now as England settle into their pastoral training idyll before their opening game against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday. Kane, who was according to the Guardian report “a cut above his teammates” during the key defeat by Italy, talked gamely about his dream of one day lifting\n",
      "Summary: Our disunited continent may be suffering a crisis of identity but for four weeks we will all be watching Almost three years ago, at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, the Euro 2024 logo was officially launched, featuring the colours of all 55 Uefa member nations in a symbolic display of continental solidarity. “It shows that in Europe we are united, we are friends,” the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, announced of the new design.” Friendship. Good values. Everyone united.“It’s a symbol of the unity of the continent, of the solidarity of the people, and of the good values that we all have, and it’ll be a symbol for the future of the European Union, for all of Europe, for the whole of the world, to come together and to be able to play together, to be united, to have a common future, and to play in the same way, as a team, as much as we can, as an individual” midfield to midfield. Yes, good luck with all that. The prospect of genuine trouble is small but real, driven as much by a populist fetish for “security” and riot gear as by any credible threat. The UK general election – landing in between the last 16 and the quarter-finals – can be soundly relied upon to generate the usual toxic discourse, bad tweets and cringeworthy photos of politicians pumping their fists at the telly. But opening night in Munich, with the hosts taut and anxious, would be the perfect opportunity to spring an ambush. For certain sections of the media and the political class, there is often a sense that football disorder is almost willed into being through craving and incantation. The fatuous supercomputer and AI predictions, the betting company stunts, the tenuous commercial tie-ups (fun tip: try to spot all the creative ways in which brands mention the Euros this summer without troubling the intellectual property lawyers), the inevitable political piggybacking. Is football really about friendship? Is it about good values, different cultures uniting, Xherdan Shaqiri and Aleksandar Mitrovic sat round a campfire playing the banjo? Or is it simply the greatest and silliest pastime humanity has yet invented for itself, a seething mass of tribal rivalry and hollow escapism and performative\n",
      "Summary: It’s The Sids … featuring the revelation that was Girona, a big year in Bilbao and the Beatles besting the Stones In the end the calendar was cruel, serving up a metaphor for the season, for football and for life. Same time, same place: mid-May, a Saturday evening at Los Carmenes. Newly confirmed league champions Real Madrid had come to play Granada, who had just watched on television in the hotel as the relegation they long knew was coming finally got sealed, players sitting in tears en route to the ground, where it was all they could so to stand in formation, applaud their opponents on to the field and then lose again. The Federation had suggested giving them the trophy that evening, but they said no. Instead, it was silently handed over behind closed doors the following morning, then taken on a bus down the Castellana to the statue of Cibeles, goddess of fertility and meeting point of Madridisimo. Like something out of a sitcom, someone had double booked a celebration and a funeral. As for Madrid, they came, played, won and got out quietly, the party postponed. Carlo Ancelotti wore the shades, smoked the cigar, danced with Eduardo Camavinga, sang a while, and then got back to work ensuring they would be back again a fortnight later. He had time on his side. Madrid had won the title seven days earlier and there were still three weeks to go. Nine months on, they didn’t need the last game. For the first time ever, the top eight and the bottom three was confirmed before the season concluded. So they immediately changed the kick-off times to every game bar one, because, hey, they’re only fans, right? It was decided: the title, second, third and fourth; who goes to the Super Cup and the Club World Cup; Champions League, Europa League and Conference League; relegation too. How far away the first felt, everything getting under way as over on the other side of the world Spain were winning the Women’S World Cup. Their success and the poignancy of Olga Carmona‘s story was soon overtaken, or given another dimension, by Luis Rubiales kissing Jenni Hermoso and the still-going, sometimes surreal fall-out from it all, the Federation president’m mum locking herself in the local church. It all began\n",

When you tell a local you’re going to Müngersdorf, the part of the city where the stadium is to be found, they’ll be left in little doubt that a day at the football is planned. The stadium, a true monument visually, has served as the permanent home of the DFB-Pokal final since 1985 and there’�s a political cold war era story behind it. West Germany desperately wanted to host the 1988 Euros but feared having a then divided city as a venue would meet with fierce resistance from eastern bloc countries within UefA. So the decision was taken to strike West Berlin from the host cities but as a “we-still-value-you” prize, the German Football Association (DFB) decided to make the stadium its Wembley for the big final.

      "Summary: Simone Inzaghi’s side won the league in the most satisfying way while their rivals imploded and managers exploded The Serie A season ended on Sunday with a showdown between two European finalists. For Italian football, this felt like confirmation of a trend. There was a Serie A club in all three Uefa club finals last year, even if they did each wind up on the losing side. Atalanta won the Europa League, after losing to Juventus in the domestic cup final. Fiorentina reached the final of the Europa Conference League and the semi-final of the Coppa Italia. They let themselves down in the Champions League, allowing a wobble to become a crisis as they fumbled a two-goal lead against Atlético Madrid. But they sealed their 20th Scudetto – and with it a second gold star for the club badge of course that was worn by Cristiano Ronaldo in the last match of the season, in the best way imaginable, beating Milan, up to that moment tied with them on 19 title wins, at San Siro. Inter rose to take their crown, playing some astonishingly good football. Despite another summer of high-profile departures – with André Onana, Edin Dzeko, Romelu Lukaku, Marcelo Brozovic and Robin Gosens all leaving – Simone Inzaghis took his team to new levels, developing tactics so fluid that we saw goals from open play in which one member of the back three crossed for another to finish. Juventus were the only team who threatened to challenge, somehow keeping pace with Inter through the first half of the campaign and occupying top spot for a moment at the start of 2024. A one-point gap between them and the Nerazzurri became 20 in the space of two months. Yet the football calendar pressed on. The only downside to cup success was a punishing fixture list that left no space to make up a postponed game. Fortunately, there was not much riding on the match by the time it finally took place. Juventus had already won the domestic title, while winning the Coup Italia for the first time in their history, and had already helped to secure a fifth Italian spot in next season‘s revamped Champions League. Even before atalanta thumped Bayer Leverkusen in Dublin last month, ending the German club’ s unbeaten campaign and claiming their first ever European trophy, they were already on the verge of a\n",
      "Summary: Makram Daboub’s team are in Perth for a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday when their motivation lies with bringing some joy to those who are suffering As the final whistle rang out, waves of emotion began to crash over Michel Termanini. The weight of what had been accomplished became clear but so too what this moment would mean for so many. Palestine were set to stage a first home game since 2019 in a qualifier against Australia in the West Bank last November, but the outbreak of hostilities forced the team to “host” games across Kuwait and Qatar instead. The health ministry in Gaza said in a statement on Saturday that at least 36,801 Palestinians have been killed and more than 83,680 have been injured in Israel’�s military offensive since the conflict began on 7 October, following Hamas’‘s 7 October attack that killed approximately 1,200 and took more than 240 hostages. “We play every game with heart to with motivation from the war,” said midfielder Mohammed Rashid, who scored the only goal in a 0-0 draw against Lebanon last Thursday, “but we also play with the hope that everything will stop and peace will prevail in that area.” A desire to bring joy and prayer for peace. They are not the only ones who have been affected by the conflict in Gaza, with the ongoing death and destruction casting a long shadow. Palestine have been unable to play in their home country for more than a year and a half due to the conflict, and have been forced to look abroad to continue playing, leaving home to play on in leagues in Jordan, Egypt and Libya. Their coach, MakramDaboub, has said the players, many of whom have lost loved ones, have a “constant feeling of anxiety for their families” and, with many unable to return to their clubs, many have been left to look for work. But ultimately the progression has all been in service of a greater goal. It is the furthest the team has advanced in their attempts to secure a place at the showpiece event since joining Fifa in 1998. It was treated as such; defender Mohammed Khalil conducted the celebrations with fans before the team posed for a historic photograph. Palestine are five points clear of Lebanon in Group I with two games remaining, and a draw was as good as a win last Thursday. It has been a campaign like no other. Goals haven’t come easy\n",
      "Summary: Three men were convicted and fined $500 for ‘deliberately and intentionally’ performing the salute Three Croatian men have been convicted of publicly displaying a Nazi symbol “without reasonable excuse” during the 2022 Australia Cup soccer final. Nikola Marko Gasparovic, 46, Dominik Sieben, 25, and Marijan Lisica, 45, performed the salute at Parramatta’s CommBank Stadium on October 1 2022, during the match between Sydney United 58 and Macarthur FC. The three men did not know each other before being arrested. At the game, Sieben wore a Croatian water polo cap and had a national flag draped over his shoulders, while Lisica arrived in full-army camouflage fatigues. Magistrate Joy Boulos found beyond reasonable doubt that the three men had “determinedly” to perform the Nazi salute, rejecting their arguments the hand gesture was a symbol of Croatian national pride. “At a time when we need to reduce racial tension, all this behaviour does is to inflame those tensions and there must be a strong condemnation to others who think this behaviour is acceptable,” she told parramatta Local Court. Boulos also found that the men had not been aware of the significance of the gesture, and that the gesture was not intended to be seen as a “symbolic gesture”, but rather as “an expression of pride”. While the salute was a Nazi slogan, this did not apply to a Croatian slogan uttered by the men, “za dom spremni” meaning “For homeland, ready, to be ready” – which translates to “to be ready for the homeland” or “for the homeland, be ready, be prepared” in Croatian. ‘I find it inherently implausible that a young man with a western education in this day and age would not know what a Nazi salute is,’ she said. ” The salutes were done at times when each man was alone or others in the crowd were not cheering or waving their hands.” “I find this behaviour to be extremely offensive and offensive to all Australians, regardless of their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political affiliation, the court was told.“Nazi symbols represent hatred, abject racism, genocide and a hateful ideology.’ ” Ms Boulos sentenced Sieben and Gaspar\n",
      "Summary: The former United assistant coach discusses his transition to the top job in Minnesota, the league’s unique challenges and learning from the NBA [ Minnesota United have started the 2024 season in promising fashion. They are third in the Western Conference through 15 games. Ramsay joined a few matches into the season after his now assistant, Cameron Knowles, steered the team through the opening weeks as Ramsay waited on his work permit. Those early months have been focused on instilling togetherness and tactical organisation. Tight schedules and travel have caught out many newcomers to MLS, but the former Manchester United in NBAide coach was keen to embrace that side of the league. As soccer increasingly becomes a game of managing transitions from attack to defence, coaches are taking lessons from US sports where transition play is more intense than in Europe. “Part of the appeal of this league to me, and part of the reason I wanted to take my first steps here as a head coach, was because some of the things we’re having to deal with are things you wouldn’t necessarily have to do with at home,” Ramsay says. A road trip featuring games in Colorado and Los Angeles in the space of five days, before returning to Minnesota, posed a logistical task as well as a sporting one. The American sporting landscape is different to the majority of soccer leagues worldwide. There is no promotion or relegation, and leagues are made up of franchises rather than clubs. European leagues are mooting salary caps and MLS-like super leagues at the top level. At the lower levels, US clubs are growing organically within communities rather than markets, in the style of some older European clubs. While there will be some culture clashes as ideas of how to run soccer are exchanged across the Atlantic, more symbiotic is the exchange of ideas between sports at the coaching level. As a result, there is a growing sense of mutual respect between coaches in the US and the UK. Ramsay has seen signs of this growth around Minnesota ahead of a defining moment for the sport in the United States – the Copa America starts this month and the 2026 World Cup is on the horizon. He was recently named to Jesse Marsch‘s first squad as Canada coach.“I’ve seen a lot of people talk about how soccer is big in America,“ Ramsay says, “but I’m not sure it’ll be talked about in the same way as the other sports. We�\n",
      "Summary: Emma Hayes led the US to a pair of convincing wins over South Korea in her first two games as national team coach. The US looked much sharper and sprightly in the first game against Korea – a 4-0 win in Colorado last Saturday when the average age of the starting XI was 25.5 years – than they did in rainy Minnesota, where Hayes made nine changes and went with a more experienced lineup averaging 28 years old. Not that it was all bad news for the veterans, with Crystal Dunn, starting as a forward for the first time since 2017, scoring the opening goal from close range: her first at international level since 2018. “I have to start thinking about which players might fill multiple positions for the team and of course I’ve experimented as much as I could do in these two games,” Hayes said in her post-match press conference. The miserly Olympic squad size limit will force the coach to make some difficult choices. Excluding Morgan, who’ll be 35 during the tournament, would be a bold call given the value of her experience and link play – even if others, such as Catarina Macário, whom Hayes knows well from their time at Chelsea, can offer more versatility and zip. Adaptability could prove decisive. The visitors improved for the second encounter but the US were far more dynamic on Tuesday once Hayes hooked Alex Morgan and introduced Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith. The trio combined to set up Swanson’s first goal, a low shot from a tight angle, five minutes after coming on as 62nd-minute substitutes. A DREAM DEBUT FOR LILY!!!!#USWNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/RWlOYpLSjj Given the range of options available to Hayes as she prepares to name her Olympic squad it would be be a surprise to see Yohannes, who turns 17 next week, make an 18-player roster. Still, she is the youngest player to feature for the US since 2001, the youngest to score in the past 30 years, and, thanks to her goal, an emblem of a side looking to the future under a coach intent on reviving a team that was stale and senescent at last year‘s World Cup – a downfall years in the making. After their stilted attacking performances en route to a round-of-16 exit in 2023, Hayes will be pleased that the US\n",
      "Summary: Major League Soccer expansion team San Diego FC have signed winger Hirving “Chucky” Lozano as the club’s first Designated Player. San Diego was awarded the 30th MLS club in May 2023. It is owned by Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Mansour and the Sycuan Tribe, the first Native American tribe to have an ownership stake in a professional soccer team. The ownership group also includes San Diego Padres star third baseman Manny Machado. “We are thrilled to have him join our club as we look to build a team that will challenge for trophies. In every country I have played, I always strive to leave a mark, and making an impact in San Diego and MLS is very important to me,” lozano said. The 28-year-old has also played for Pachuca in Liga MX and Napoli. He has 18 goals in 70 appearances with the Mexican national team and played in the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. He was part of the Mexico squad that reached the quarter-finals of the 2018 Copa America Centenario in Brazil, but was left out of the squad for the final against Argentina due to a lack of playing time. He also was a member of the Mexican squad that won the 2015 Copa América Centenario. He is one of four players on the Mexican roster who have never played in a major international tournament. He’ll formally join San Diego on 1 January. Loziano signed a four-year deal through the 2028 season, the team said on Thursday. ”We are very excited to welcome Hirving to San Diego, and we look forward to welcoming him to the San Diego area. ‘Chucky' will be a great addition to our team. ’Chucky,’” Mansour said in a statement. Lozoano will remain with his current club, PSV in the Netherlands, until the end of the year. PSV recently secured their 25th title in the Dutch top league. Loozano scored six goals and added three assists in 24 matches during the 2023-24 season. He scored twice in the 2017-18 Dutch Cup. He played for PSV during the 2018-19 season.

      "Summary: When it comes time to remember the Socceroos’ 2-0 win over Bangladesh on Thursday evening most will do well to recall much beyond it marking the start of what – hopefully – was the first of a long and successful career in green and gold for Nestory Irankunda. For Graham Arnold, however, he’s grateful his side will be leaving Dhaka unscathed after playing on an “unacceptable” pitch. Sign up to Australia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter and email newsletter. A fifth win in as many World Cup qualifiers doing little to temper his frustration with the conditions at the Bashundhara Kings Arena – which was patchy before kickoff and degraded significantly as the game wore on – was dangerous. “Terrible. We had the chances to score five or six, seven. But some of the tackles, potential injuries, was stressing me out last night. I’m not passing responsibility that the field was [the reason] we only won two goals,” Arnold told reporters after the match. ”I’d like to think that we’re a better team than we were in the first half and Daniel the second half, but I think the field is not good.“ All eyes were centred on Irankund when it was revealed he would make his international debut, but the game that saw him become cap number 642 for Australia won’t go down in the annals of history – even if he‘s ultimately awarded an assist if Hrustić’z effort remains his and doesn’ts go down as an own goal. Hope, instead, will be that it becomes a notable piece of trivia marking the commencement of what becomes a long or successful career. For much like the rest of his teammates, the teen crashed repeatedly against a packed Bangladeshi backline in stinking hot conditions and high humidity. He should have had a penalty minutes before halftime but eventually got his reward when he sent in a pinpoint delivery – one of the few produced by the Socceroo on the evening – for Yengi to head in for the second the 62nd minute.

The player said he was “very happy” to be leaving PSG, but admitted he was unhappy with some of the club officials and the way he was treated at the end of his time in France, which he described as a “sad end”. ‘I wasn’t unhappy at PSG’ “It was a very sad end,” he said, “it was a sad ending. Yet just to play, to win trophies was my biggest pride.“I was very happy at [PSG] but I was very unhappy at the club. I was not happy at the way I was treated, I was unhappy. But next season I won‘t be satisfied with a season like that. I will be better than that. ” Although he scored 44 goals in 48 games and won the French league and French Cup double, Mbambé struggled at times during his final season in France.

      "Summary: Thousands of fans have packed into Fenerbahce’s Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul to witness José Mourinho signing his contract to become their new manager. The 61-year-old Portuguese manager flew in to Istanbul on Sunday from his stint as a television pundit at the Champions League final at Wembley. He is reported to have signed a two-year deal, with the Super Lig club confirming his arrival on Sunday morning. Mourinho, a Champions League winner with Porto and Internazionale, has been out of work since being sacked by Roma in January. “Normally a coach is loved after victories. In this case I feel that I am loved before the victories. Football is passion, and there is no better place [than here] to feel that passion.” Mourinho, who has also managed Chelsea, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Tottenham during his storied career, replaces Ismail Kartal, who left the club on Friday. Kartal oversaw just one league defeat this season, but that was still not enough to prevent Galatasaray from winning the title by three points. The club, who finished second in the league last season, will now be looking for a new coach to take them back to the top of the table, having failed to win the title for the first time since 2010-11. Mourinho said he was “delighted” to be joining the club, which he described as “the soul of the football club”, and that he was looking forward to working with the club’“I want to work in Turkish football. I want to be the coach of all of you. That for me is a big responsibility that I feel. ” His immediate target will be securing the 19-time Turkish champions their first title since 2013-14. Mourinho will also be looking to secure a place in next season's Champions League. While there, he told Sky Sports about the difficulty Fenerbace face in trying to qualify for next season‘s competition. ‘If I go, you know that I like challenges’ “[It is] hard to qualify, so we are going to fight to be in the [Champions League] group stage,” he said. Mourinho also spoke about the challenges ahead of him in the Turkish league this season and next year. � “I promise you from this moment, I belong to your family. This shirt\n",
      "Summary: England’s enduring defensive key-slab deserves a little fond applause – and his absence requires a profound adjustment It’ll be a while before we get a chance to say goodbye to Jack Grealish and Harry Maguire. Farewell then, chaps. Put out more flowers. You will both be missed across the next four weeks. But they don’t play in the same positions. And in that regard alone this is an unusually poignant moment of severance. For Big H is gone. And with him a very distinct kind of thread has been cut. These players are essentially a projector screen, scribble pads for our dreams and hopes and feelings of how we want to look to the world. The age of playtime, feelings, club-culture vibes is clearly done. Gareth Southgate has taken a sensible view on this, for which he should be commended, as he should for picking a squad that is notably sharp-elbowed and ambitious. There are good reasons for the lack of hand-wringing. On the radio this morning I heard a very experienced and sensible broadcaster exclaim: “If I was picking the team tomorrow, would I pick Grealis, Mainoo or Wharton?! Grealist every day!!” Which is fine. Such things can easily get the better of logic. This is like saying, if I’m hungry what would I choose to eat? A flavourless stick of durum wheat semolina flour? Or a Twix? Twix every time, amiright! Follow this line of reasoning and you’re going to end up watching Jeff Stelling force down a steaming plate of bolognese sauce stacked up, not on spaghetti, but on a pile of oozing, melting Twix bars, while at the next table France, Portugal and Spain enjoy a balanced meal of salad, protein and carbohydrate. Is that really what you want? Well is it? Grealisch has had an under-par season. He will surely be back soon. If he does come again it may or may not be in Southgate‘s company. But Magoire, well, perhaps not. There is a paradox here. Of the two, Grealishes has been the most significant player of all the squad, announced this week in a kind of Love Island drip-drip of leaks and\n",
      "Summary: I hope to raise a national issue with Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer on Wednesday that deeply affects every community such as ours: the football governance bill. Although the bill was well advanced, it did not pass through the “wash-up” of policies before the election and I am among a small minority pleased about the delay, because it creates the opportunity for improvements before the bill is passed. There are three practical areas that could help improve the bill towards this goal. First, the independent regulator must be able to set the financial parameters any broadcasting deal must meet, including distribution among all clubs and terms of parachute payments. Second, as Bowers makes clear, there should be no vested interests in the decision-making process. No one involved in the regulator should work for the Premier League, English Football League, Football Association, National League or for any organisation significantly funded by these entities. Finally, while it may seem trivial, given there will be additional costs for clubs to implement legal changes mandated by the regulator, support from the clubs and traditional group could be required. Without clear upfront specifications, we could see a prolonged process whereby the premier league challenges the regulator in eternal legal reviews. Beyond these practical measures, there is a larger moral argument to be made about “who the game belongs to”, which has been somewhat lost in the purely economic debates about the distribution of TV money. A more expansive conversation from politicians about culture, history and fairness could bridge the differing perspectives of the PL and EFL. That they have been unable to agree a deal can be better understood through the framework suggested by Jonathan Haidt in his book The Righteous Mind. The book argues that people’s values are influenced by six fundamental moral foundations: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, sanctity/degradation and liberty/oppression. Liberals tend to prioritise care and fairness, while conservatives give loyalty and integrity a greater weight, while liberals tend to prioritize integrity and loyalty, while Conservatives tend to give fairness and integrity less weight. The righteous mind is a book on the decline of standards in public life called Downward Spiral. This excellent book serves as a timely reminder, as we approach a general election, of how much we have normalised misbehaviour and accepted the lack of integrity among some politicians – a trend that seemed to reach its zenith under the Conservative leadership of Boris Johnson\n",
      "Summary: It always starts the same and ends the same way but winning with spite in a seething cauldron is the manager’s currency Towards the end of the second hour, with the time beginning to drag like heat, and even the flies losing the will to live, José Mourinho leans towards the microphone. He doesn’t appear to be remotely embarrassed by this at all. “After 20 years of football,” he announces with a wry smile, “this is the longest press conference of my career. This means I am not in my comfort zone. For me, Fenerbahce means ambition.” “What is ambition?” Mourinho asks. Hang on, you think. Did he even get sacked by Roma, or was it “mutual consent”? Of course, the unspoken part was left unspoken for a reason. And of course it always starts like this: with smiles and quips, with handshakes and camera flashes, and the promise of something new and pristine. Even as he arrives, you can see the outline of how it ends, identify the faultlines that will one day turn into deadly rifts, spot the weaknesses that Mourinho one day brandish as excuses. And in an age when clubs increasingly derive revenue not just from gate receipts but from engagement, not just the capacity of their stadium but the kind of story they can sell for public consumption, there is a tangible value in being able to offer the impression of renewal. With warm tributes to his predecessor and a catchy pre-written slogan – “the shirt is going to be my skin,“ Yild Y, ” he says at his unveiling – and the sincerely expressed belief that there is nowhere on Earth he would rather be than right here, in Europe‘s ninth-best league, at a club that has won the title in a decade, diligently preparing for the Champions League second qualifying round in late July. He appears genuinely invested in the product. José sincerely reclining into his business‑class airline seat. Jose sincerely flogging sticker albums on the telly. José genuinely plugging some new football app. And he is genuinely excited to be there. Incidentally this is what makes him – at the age of 61, with his best coaching years well in the past – such an irresistible target for brands and sponsors. How we reached this point is one of those stories that feels instinctively familiar, and\n",

So apologies, Germany, we know you’ve done OK lately but best to get a tissues ready. Eight years on from delivering humiliation in Nice, Iceland were back at it, thunder-clapping their way to a 1-0 victory on Friday to keep the favourites – who now have one win in their last five – humble before Euro 2024 kicks off. Ivan Toney and Ollie Watkins will hope their bibs offer a similar dose of magic. So what should England fans do here: label this as a crisis-in-waiting or brush it off as an exercise in experimentation? Sob over pictures of Jack Grealish, national hero of the pandemic Euros, or fire up “Anthony Gordon – Crazy Dribbling Skills, Goals & Assists – 2024” on YouTube and trust Gareth Southgate has got this? England’�s manager is probably calm, aided by his fine tournament record. But he’ll have to come up with a plan on how to actually win the trophy. First up, Gareth, don’t host the bloody thing. Doing it the ugly way is just fine. That being said, a bit of firepower in the reserves wouldn‘t go amiss. The player of the tournament in 2021 was Italy’m goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma, who kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Croatia in the group stage and was aided by two grizzled, been-there-done-that centre-backs in front of him, Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini.

      "Summary: Plus: winning the FA Youth Cup and FA Cup in double-quick time, Jude Bellingham’s two-league feat, and more “Last week, in their Ligue 1 relegation/promotion playoff quarter-final, Rodez beat Paris FC in a penalty shootout despite missing their first three kicks,” notes Neal Parsons. “Has this happened before?” Before we answer the question, a moment please to reflect on the kind of match that only playoffs can produce. The first game that came to mind, for us and a few of you, was Wolves v Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup. That penalty competition is memorable for three reasons: the Wednesday keeper Kevin Pressman showing how to take the perfect penalty, Wolves recovering spectacularly from that moment onwards, and poor Chris Waddle missing decisively in sudden death. And for my first 30 years, I used to think of Town as being unlucky. When they were 2-0 up after three penalties apiece, they had nine goals to their name. And that was from the off. We thought Wolves had missed their first 3 penalties but it turns out they missed only the first two. The rest of the penalties were scored by the Wednesday players. Pressman was the first to score a penalty in the shootout, and the second to score the winner, and then the third, and so on. 📂Kevin Pressman └📁 Penalty moments    ⚽️   └ #Wolves v Sheff Wed in the #FA Cup in 1994-95. 💪🏻‍♂️ #SheffWednesday v Wolves in the 1995-96 #FACup in a footnote, Pe’en of Nottingham they missed their last three kicks as a footnote they won the match 2-1 in extra time, and they were the first team to score two goals after extra time in the final of the then Rothmans Cup (roughly equivalent to the English League Cup). ⛽️ Goal v Wolves https://t.co/JUJAAB26wH pic.twitter.com/zQn4NcJHzA And then it all unravelled thus: Gordon Cowans scores Wolves 1-3 Sheff wed Andy Pearce misses Wolves 1–1 Sheff Tue Kevin Pressmann scores Wolves 2-3 Sheffield Wednesday Wed Chris Bart-Williams misses Wolves 2–1 Sheffield United Wed Chris W\n",

      "Summary: FA Sápmi, a football association representing the Sámi people indigenous to a vast stretch of northern Scandinavia, will be the hosts. The tournament will be held over five days in Bodø, the northern Norwegian city that is this year’s European capital of culture. The Conifa president, Per-Anders Blind, who is of Norwegian origin and who is also the president of the Norwegian Football Association (Ørvalsforeningen), is confident that the tournament will eventually be an important one for the development of the sport in the country. “I’m very excited to see what happens here, and afterwards.” The 29-year-old lives in the south of Norway – as is the case for most of the squad – and plays for the Kristiansund-based side Våg FK in the fourth tier. Marja Sofe Holmestrand Hætta is the captain of the team, and also took part in the squad in India. The goalkeeper has been involved with the sámi setup for almost 15 years, since she was a teenager. The captain will be wearing a Gákti – the traditional Sámic outfit that is nowadays reserved for special occasions – during the opening ceremony next week, as she also did when she represented Sámmi in the Arctic Winter games. ” I’ve always wanted to be a goalkeeper,” she tells Moving the Goalposts, “but I didn’t know what to do about it. I live in southern Norway, and when I told my friends that I was going to represent Sáomi in a world championship, they would ask me: ‘What is that?’” “Marja”s head coach, Elin Nicolaisen, says: ”Marja is very proud of her identity. She wears the national Sámis dress and when she puts on the captain’d armband and the national anthem plays she gets very emotional.“ While preparations for the Olympic tournament this summer are in full swing, next week will feature another international competition fighting for recognition. Kicking off next Tuesday, the 24th edition of the Conifa World Cup will be hosted by the Norwegian football association. This year, the two teams will be joined by Székely Land – the Hungarian-speaking population of Transylvania, in Romania – and\n",

      "Summary: The Norwegian is only 23 but his devastating goal record has seen him voted as the No 1 player in the world by the Guardian’s expert panel When Pep Guardiola tearfully claimed Manchester City could not replace the departing Sergio Agüero in May 2021, he didn’t just create a meme. Guardiola was soft-launching a global audition for his team’d new attacking talisman. An unsuccessful pursuit of Harry Kane in the summer of 2021 came between two title-winning seasons where Ilkay Gündogan (13) and Kevin De Bruyne (15) were the club’m top league goalscorers, and the club was on the verge of winning the Champions League for the first time in a decade, and a second consecutive Premier League title in the same year. The only thing missing was the elusive European trophy. The club had failed to win a trophy in the last three seasons, and in the space of the last 16 last 16 games he scored five goals, perhaps the most in the history of the competition. The lack of a second striker in the squad in the second half of the year came the same time as the club won the title, but the lack of one in the first half came the second. The absence of the second goal towards the end of the season meant that the goals created is the club is on course for a third title in a row, and it came between a season where the duo of Ilkaygündoğan (12) and Raheem Sterling (14) both scored 15 goals; Ilkay gündogg (12), and the pair of Leroy Sane (11) each scored 10 goals in the league, while the club also created the most goals in Europe with the Bayern Munich to Bayern’ trophy Haaland as substituted, perhaps a little too early, but he still managed to score five goals in five games to Bayern Munich’ win the Bundesliga title.

The World Cup winner triumphed by a clear margin, finishing more than 500 points ahead of second-placed Sam Kerr. Out of our 112 judges, 103 voted the Spaniard their No 1 player of 2024, with the England and England Lionesses’ star and Sandra Pañira this year in third. Kerr, who was also in the top three last year, will now miss most of 2024 with the same injury, sustained this month during a training camp with Chelsea. Injuries and a World Cup meant there was a definite changing of the guard in terms of the number of players making the top 100 this year. Jenni Hermoso, Lucy Bronze, Wendie Renard, Pernille Harder, Saki Kumagai and Lieke Martens-van Leer are the only players to have made the list every year since 2016, while 31 players make their debut on this year’. Experience counts too, though, with Kosovare Asllani, Alex Morgan and Eugénie Le Sommer – the latter returning to the top 10 for the first time – all 34 years old with the Lyon and France forward one of only four players to return to the rankings after dropping out last year.

Caicedos also moves up into the top 20, while there is a record number of new entrants to the list, including a quartet of 20-year-olds in Paralluelo, Melchie Dumornay, Mary Fowler and Esmee Brugts. Two new entrants make the list this year from last year with the Manchester City and England forward Emily Van Egmond moving up to ninth. Walsh, along with Alexandra Popp and Caroline Graham Hansen, consolidate a top 10 spot from this year, while Mapi León and Mary Earps move up into that section for the top time.

      "Summary: Kylian Mbappé’s career has been carefully planned but the end of his PSG stay was flat. Can the national team offer a reboot? Cristiano Ronaldo was already 24 years old, with three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the Club World Cup on his honours list when the CR7 trademark was registered in June 2009, just under a year after it had been used for the first time to promote a line of underwear. The Manchester United player had also scored 22 goals in 66 games for Portugal. He had taken part in three major international tournaments and reached the final of the 2004 European Championship. Everything – including a dream move to Real Madrid – was in place to monetise his on-field achievements as no other footballer had ever done before. Ronaldo was different. Unlike Ronaldo, he did not become a project as he grew into not just an exceptional footballer, but a footballer of project. He was the imp with a winning smile, not a frowning footballing superman gifted with the physique of a kouros. The image he projected as a very young man exploding on to the French football scene was that of a happy-go-lucky, slightly mischievous, even cartoonish character who was out to have fun – and make fun of others too. You could imagine him looking back and thumbing his nose at the defenders he regularly left in his trail, his heels kicking sparks and clouds of dust off the pitch. He giggled when he saw his face projected on the giant screens of the Stade de France. He laughed when he was told that he was the best player in the world, not just the best in France, but in the whole of the world. He smiled when he said that he had the talent, the looks and, more importantly, a near-exhibitionistic keenness to be filmed, photographed and admired. That he was a prodigy was not in doubt. All of Europe knew it by then, and France had known it for a while. Word of his unique qualities had spread throughout European scouting circles and he had been the most talked about player in France from the age of six. This was not to say that he would be the most fertile player to play for France in the next few years, but it was clear from the start that his career was going to be one of the most successful in the history of French football, and he was destined to be the best footballer in the\n",

It was a huge success and is, quite simply, my favourite ever podcast. As such, I felt compelled to talk to the hosts Josh Widdieombe’m a bit of a fan of the show, as well as about 90s football in general. SN You went out with a bang with your final live show at the London Palladium last month. JW Totally. You can’t often say that. SN Michael, it must be weird for you as a United fan to hear someone say they like your team from the 90s whereas at the time I despised them. MM I’d agree. Having done this podcast I now find myself liking the Manchester United team of the 60s and 70s, and I find it quite nice to hear people talk about it. One thing that has really stayed with me from that night is a tweet I saw from someone who said how nice it was before the show to see so many people in the pub talking about other teams, and there’�s definitely something about looking back to the past that means you lose that tribalism.

      "Summary: Players say they do not get proper meals and are unable to claim expenses in latest crisis for women’s game in the country Four footballers from Argentina’ve left the national team in a dispute over “humiliating” pay and poor training conditions. The players went on strike, saying they were struggling financially after their stipends of about $10 went unpaid. The goalkeeper Laurina Oliveros, the midfielder Lorena Benítez, and the defenders Julieta Cruz and Eliana Stábile walked out and called for greater investment in the womens game. “We reached a point in which we are tired of the injustices, of not being valued, not being heard and, even worse, being humiliated,” Cruz posted on social media, along with a picture of the squad. The women, who all play for Boca Juniors, also cited issues with food. ”We have been carrying a lot of things throughout all these years of representing our country, many colleagues have left for the same reasons, for feeling sadness and not joy every time it is time to be there.” It is common to see women and girls donning football shirts around Buenos Aires, and playing in post-work five- or 11-a-side matches in mixed and women-only teams. But Argentinian women say their enthusiasm for the game is not matched by sufficient investment. The Argentinian Football Association could not confirm the players’ decision to walk out, but said in a statement that it was “deeply disappointed”. According to local news reports, the average monthly salary for a female player in Argentina”s Primera División is $203,500 (£178), forcing most players to have jobs. The national team’ salary is $2,000 (£1,500) a month. Benítz said the team was not given breakfast or lunch during recent training sessions – only a ham and cheese sandwich and a banana afterwards – and had been told “there is no money”, adding: “I am not only talking about finances. I speak about training, having lunch, breakfast.“ Their decision came days before back-to-back matches against Costa Rica, games the players said they were unable to collect tickets for because they were being held in Buenos Aires. She added that the players and their families were also charged 5,000 pesos (£4.\n",
      "Summary: As club’s powerful owners rail against ‘the elites’ in legal battle with Premier League, there is a looming danger to the game Here we are then, at last. The chrysalis has finally hatched. The thing that was always going to be the thing has now become the thing. Greed may have opened the door. Hedge funds and leveraged buyouts are their own kind of evil. There are no good elite football owners. But then, this is the autocratic billionaire lens. And nothing must be allowed to intrude on the exercise of power. The ghost of Milton Friedman says: this is not capitalism. This is about control, hard power and a quarter century of yee-hawing wild west governance and oversight. Welcome to a very Premier League kind of coup. Not so much the richest guy at the table failing to get his way in a boardroom vote. This isn’t the whole story however. Here we have a richer-than-god inherited monarchy, owners of the most powerful football club in the world, somehow presenting themselves as outsiders. Why, other than other than their own greed, blind blind greed, do they want a Premier League club? Governments are not supposed to be in the business of buying and selling clubs. Invite a tiger in for tea and the tiger might be fun. It might even be a bit of a good time. But it’ll eat you. And in the end it is going to eat you too. And it will eat the rest of us too. As news emerged of Manchester City and Abu Dhabi, the owners of Manchester United and the owner of the Etihad Stadium, filing a potentially devastating legal case against English footballs top tier while refusing to sell the club to the great Belgian Belgian and Ant, it was tempting to see a kind of parable. L’état c’est nous. But the question here seems ever more profound. When will the boundlessly rich kings and princes of the overclass finally be able to take a seat at the top table? Other than now, and for ever, in every single sphere of life?

      "Summary: Five years ago we picked 80 of the most talented players in the world to follow their progress in a cut-throat business It is the time of year when we check in on the Next Generation players we picked in 2018 to follow for five years, to assess their progress amid success, setbacks, injuries, trophies won and transfers made. Next Generation started in 2014 with the aim of showing the difficulties that even the best prospects in the Premier League (we pick one from each club at first-year scholar age) and the rest of the world (we choose 60 born in a specific calendar year) face on their way towards the top. In 2018 Sweden’s Kevin Ackermann made the list, with Olof Lundh writing: A defensively minded midfielder who is incredibly strong (he used to be a wrestler) but with an excellent touch to go with his physicality. Made his debut in the Swedish top flight as a 16-year-old last year and captained Sweden as they reached the quarter-finals of the Euro Under-17 tournament in England this summer. Has signed a new contract with the club from Hisingen until 2021 despite interest from Real Madrid and Benfica and trials at both Manchester clubs. We have to remember that playing second-tier football in most countries, Sweden included, is an incredible achievement considering all the competition. Ackermanns seemed destined for the top – the question was just in which country he would play – but having opted to join Fiorentina in Italy, he and his family got the shock of their lives. A heart defect was spotted during the medical and, after months of uncertainty, in April 2019 he had an operation, not dissimilar to the one that Nwankwo Kanu, the then Internazionale and Nigeria forward who later joined Arsenal, had to have in 1996. The operation was a success but he then had to start all over again, not exceeding a heart rate of 140 during sessions in the beginning and then simply walking 20,000 steps a day. A career path that once seemed obvious was now shrouded in doubt, an incredibly difficult situation to be in for an adult, never mind a teenager. As he returned to first-team training at Häcken in August 2019, he said: “I am so happy to be back. I was down all the way to the bottom but I’ve learned a lot and have got to know myself better as a person and\n",
      "Summary: If you want a child to make this list, you better make sure he is born as soon as possible after 1 September Last month the Guardian released Next Generation 2022: 20 of the best talents at Premier League clubs. As with previous years it selected “the best youngsters at each club”, this time among those born between 1 September 2005 and 31 August 2006, an age band known as “first-year scholars”. The reader will recognise there is nothing wrong in the way the Guardian selected these players. After all, scouts choose children according to what they see. This is how professional scouts select players, too. But the brain works in mysterious ways, and I did something different this year: I looked at the month of birth of these players, not just the year of birth, but also the quarter of the year in which they were born. The Guardian’s selection of the 20 best talent at Premier league clubs since 2014 was also 13-7; then, counting back to 2014, it was 15-5, 14-6,14-6 and 15-7, and then in 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25, 2025-26, 2026-27, 2027-28, 2028-29, 2029-30, 2030-31, 2031-32, 2032-33, 2033-34, 2034-35, 2035-36, 2036-37, 2037-38, 2038-39, 2039-40, 2040-41, 2041-42, 2042-43, 2043-44, 2044-45, 2045-46, 2046-47, 2047-48, 2048-49, 2049-50, 2051-52, 2052-53, 2053-54, 2054-55, 2055-56, 2056-57, 2057-58, 2059-60, 2061-61, 2062-63, 2063-64, 2064-65, 2065-66, 2066-67, 2067-68, 2068-69, 2069-70, 2070-71, 2071-72, 2072-73, 2073-74,\n",

F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali addressed complaints raised by the teams over flooded hospitality units and leaking roofs during the rain-hit race. Team personnel, guests and media were also dismayed at the lack of suitable parking provisions, with only a muddy track linking an overflow car park to the paddock. A statement from the organisers sent to Autosport said: “Regarding [the car park] and egress, we sincerely apologised and understand the frustration that this has caused, we acknowledge that what transpired is unacceptable and put in mitigation measures for the Sunday including an alternative route. “We are well aware that leaky tents and media booths are not up to the standard we wish to uphold and will be having serious follow-ups with the third parties involved.” The promoter also responded after a breakdown in communication left some race fans unable to enter the track on Friday. A number of spectators were wrongly told that both practice sessions had been cancelled due to the heavy rain. The Canadian Grand Prix has a deal to remain on the calendar until 2031 and, this year, enjoyed a record attendance of 350,000 spectators over the three days.

The STM said it had been in contact with the promoter to inform them of the cancellation of the practice sessions, but the decision was made by the STM to cancel the sessions themselves. A further breakdown in communications left some spectators unable to get into the track.

Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images Although a scrappy race from George Russell and Lewis Hamilton ultimately meant the chances of a victory from pole position slipped through its grasp, a deeper dive of its weekend pace has prompted the competition to reappraise where it sees Mercedes in the pecking order. As McLaren team principal Andrea Stella admitted, Mercedes is now delivering a car that in dry conditions at least appears to be out of touch for anything his squad can do at certain points of race weekends. The way Mercedes made an impact on the opposition in Canada was not just about lap times though, because there was some other evidence over the weekend about its strong form being more noticeable. All season there have been signs of speed from the W15, but it has been inconsistent – and the team has especially struggled when it comes to getting the best out of the car in both low and high-speed corners. “I was already saying on Thursday to some of your colleagues that I think Mercedes is part of the fastest teams,” he said. But what we don’t know, of course, is fuel loads – and that may well be the answer as to why Wolff was so happy about things. For if Hamilton was able to pull that form off with race levels of fuel, then that looked very promising indeed. Reflecting on the weekend and the promise shown by the team, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff be clear that it was not that single lap that offered the best insight into things. ”I think we have a lot of potential in the car, and I think they're starting to learn how to use it.” One such of those out-of-reach moments came on Saturday morning in Canada when Hamilton dominated final free practice with a lap that was 0.374 seconds faster than Max Verstappen’s Red Bull. While some of that gap may have been flattered from using an extra set of soft tyres, it would be wrong to suggest that this run was just a bit of showboating that did not tell the true picture of relative form. The W15 has been out the fast stuff has been over the past few years, but the team is now showing that it is starting to get the most out of it in the low-speed corner, and it has also been able to get some of the\n",

But the result was probably not as good as the team could have hoped for, with the pace of its W15 having been super strong at various points of the weekend. A new front wing that Mercedes introduced to help complement a recent upgrade appears to have transformed the balance characteristics of its car and suggested that the squad had finally started to unlock the secrets of the current ground effect machinery. Watch: Canadian GP Race Review - Wet and Wild Vs Cool and Calm With plans for more developments including a new floor set for the next race in Spain amid  current race in Barcelona, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff admitted there was a sense that his squad was finally moving away from the difficulties it had in the past of improvement not delivering what had been hoped for. “I think definitely, since Imola, we've taken the right steps and put parts on the car that are working, something that we were struggling in the last couple of years,” he said. Mercedes W15 nose and front wing detail Photo by; Giorgio Piola He adds the progress has been helped by a raft of changes and an improved understanding of flow structures, that is helping it unlock what is needed. While Russell and Valtteri Bottas finished third and fourth at the Canadian GP, respectively, it was not a result that the team was expecting. Asked after the race if he felt Mercedes had a car to win, Wolff said: “Maybe for a few minutes, we dreamt about it, but in reality, probably not. So that's good.” While much of the focus of the step forward that Mercedes has made has surrounded a new design for the front wing and the addition of a new nose and a new set-up for the rear end of the car to help improve the performance of front wing, Wolol says that the improvements to the car are much more involved than that. ”Sometimes when you bring a highly-visible part like a bodywork or front wing or rear wing, this is pretty much the talk of what has changed the performance,“ he said, “But the truth is we have, over the last three races,\n",

The deal was announced as two years, but actually is a one-plus-one arrangement. With Red Bull likely having performance clause requirements, it means he’ll be once again racing on year-to-year basis in 2025. With plenty of help from the wild weather last weekend, this race was easily the best of the season so far. But around this and the weather, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve seemed to creak at the seams. Police restricting access to the track on Friday and Saturday at a key bridge caused big traffic problems for people trying to enter the paddock, while the parking grass banks across the 1976 Olympics rowing lake entrance were turned into mudbaths. Rain also flooded hospitality units and F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali apologised to team bosses for the problems. Fans also faced a cancelled performance from rapper Pitbull after he failed to show due to a problem with his plane. And spectators entering the track before the cars had returned to the pits post-race earned the promoter a stinging rebuke from the stewards. All of this followed the FIA unveiling its 2026 chassis design plans as the event commenced, which wasn’t exactly greeted with total enthusiasm.

Complaints were raised after a breakdown in communication between the circuit and police saw team members and guests stranded for hours when the entrance to the track was closed on Friday and Saturday. The circuit is located on the man-made Notre Dame Island that was constructed in the Saint Lawrence River and used as a venue for the 1976 Olympic Games.

Other problems included flooded hospitality units, which are partially floating on a lake used for the rowing competition during the '76 Summer Games. A lack of suitable parking saw the VIP parking turned into a mud bath, much to the dismay of high-fee-paying guests. TV commentary booths in the new pit lane building were also leaking and caused damage to equipment. Autosport asked the circuit promoter for a comment but has not had a response.

Photo by: Simon Galloway / Motorsport Images A race win is something all Formula 1 drivers dream of achieving throughout their career, although for many it is not something they are able to claim. With a record-breaking 24 race season, there are more opportunities than ever for drivers to claim their first victory. On the flip side there’s plenty of chance to continue to rack up career points, without taking the top prize. Lando Norris has officially removed himself from the list of most points without a win after his win at the Miami Grand Prix, when the McLaren driver took his debut win after previously standing on the podium 15 times. Norris – who beat Max Verstappen by 7.6 seconds – said he never doubted he could win a race despite people doubting his abilities. The Brit said: “I've been more confident than ever this year that I've got what it takes.

The McLaren driver found himself locked in a fight for the final podium spot with Mercedes duo George Russell and Lewis Hamilton in the Montreal race but could not hold them back in the end as he came home fifth. He reckoned that his hopes of a top three spot evaporated in the closing stages, when Russell and Hamilton clearly showed they aggressively wanted to move forward and passed him. Asked how close he felt he had been to a podium, Piastri said: “Pretty close until I got behind the Mercedes, and then I realized that they were on a mission. “I tried my best to stay in front, but I think just on the new tyres they were clearly a lot quicker than everybody. Even in Q2, when George did an 11.7 and I did a 12.1 or 12.2, I wasn't going to find half a second.

Horner reckoned that things would have been different if Norris had pitted just one lap earlier, as Verstappen's tyres would not have been up to temperature. Instead, he suggests that the “crucial” decision came later in the race when drivers started moving across to the slicks and Norris elected to run longer than everyone else. “I thought we were in a much better window as the circuit dried out,” explained Horner. When you drive out of the pitlane, you lose a huge amount of the temperature. Whilst Lando was able to capitalise enough to hit the 20-second mark, and it hovered around that, with each lap we did, the tyres were getting warmer and I was surprised they didn't cover after one lap. Then pitstops came and we went onto another new set of inters. So that timing was crucial. Lando Norris, McLaren MCL38, Max VerstAppen, Red Bull Racing RB20 Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images “They left him for two and that was crucial as that gave Max another lap to generate the temperature, and that gave Lando a free pass.” The importance of the timing of that switch to slicks came after Horner admitted McLaren had looked on course to win when Norris enjoyed a huge pace advantage on the drying track in the first stint. But his call to stick it out for two further laps did not quite work out, even though he had a 20‑second advantage over Verstepen at the time. Although he was then able to emerge from the pits marginally in front of the Dutchman, the exit blended on to a damp part of the track and he could not get traction – which allowed his rival running on the dry line to pass him for the lead.    Horner said he was not surprised by the way the race unfolded. While McLaren had lost the lead to Verstupen in the early stages of the race after the first safety car stop for Logan Sargeant’s stranded Williams, Horner does not think that was the key moment that opened the door for his team  victory. He believes it was a combination of luck and strategy that allowed the team to rebound to win the race.  \"   Norris   had a good start to the\n",

Autosport understands that, as it's not the first time a similar incident has happened at Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, the FIA decided to firm up its response by formally summoning the Canadian promoters, the Octane Racing Group, over the recurring issue. The Montreal race was attended by a record number of 350,000 spectators across the four-day event, up from 345,000 in 2023, and was plagued by several other logistical issues on the cramped environment of the man-made island that houses the semi-permanent circuit. Fans at the end of the Australian GP Photo by: Lionel Ng / Motorsport Images In addition to spectators invading the track while cars were still running, some fans also reached the stranded Haas of Nico Hulkenberg. Canada's entertaining wet-to-dry race was won by Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who defeated McLaren driver Lando Norris and Mercedes' polesitter George Russell. Watch: Canadian GP Race Review - Wet and Wild Vs Cool and Calm After investigating the incident, the stewards found the local promoter in breach of article 12.2.1.h of the International Sporting Code, noting a \"failure to take reasonable measures, thus resulting in an unsafe situation\". They judged that based on video evidence \"the security measures and/or security officers and/ or equipment which were expected to be in place for the event were not either enforced or were not sufficient resulting in a unsafe environment for the spectators and drivers.\" In the stewards’ hearing the promoter admitted that the event's security precautions were not robust enough to prevent an early track invasion, despite allocating more resources to it, and agreed the situation was not acceptable and would be investigated thoroughly. They also urged the FIA to look into the matter as it relates to a serious issue around safety and security, and warned another repeat would be met with a significant financial penalty. The stewards decided that the promoter must present a formal remediation plan to the FIA by 30 September that will lay out how the situation will be prevented from happening again. Early track invasions are not uncommon, with the Australian Grand Prix promoters also pulled up over similar problems at the 2023 edition of the Melbourne race. In response the post-race Australian GP track invasion was banned for 2024, marking a temporary end to a long-standing Melbourne tradition.   \n",

After hitting a wet patch of road with his right-hand side slick tyres, Perez clattered into the Turn 6 barriers on Lap 53 of a wet-to-dry race on Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. Perez severely damaged his Red Bull's rear wing by rear-ending the outside wall, but was asked by the team to bring his car back to the pits. His team-mate Max Verstappen was leading the race at the time by a five-second margin to McLaren's Lando Norris, which he would have lost if Perez had parked his car on the spot.  As he limped back slowly to the pitlane for more than half a lap, Perez shed more debris from his ailing RB20, which prompted the FIA race stewards to look into whether or not Red Bull had breached the rules regarding leaving a car out in an unsafe condition. They deemed Perez and Red Bull guilty of violating the corresponding article of the sporting regulations and handed Perez a three-place grid penalty for the next race in Barcelona. The team will also cough up a 25,000 euro fine for the infringement. In the hearing Red Bull admitted that it had asked the Mexican to stay out to avoid a safety car.

By virtue of Max Verstappen’s hard-fought Montreal F3 victory and the retirements of both Ferrari drivers, Red Bull more than doubled its constructors’ championship lead over the Scuderia to 49 points. But this was not helped by Perez, who had failed to escape Q1 on Saturday and then struggled to make progress in the grand prix before crashing and retiring on lap 51  of 70, leaving his points total for the last three races at just four – a sum bettered by 10 drivers in the same period and level to that of under-pressure Daniel Ricciardo. “It was a horrible weekend for Checo and obviously, we picked up some damage,” Horner told Sky Sports.  “On Saturday, we had a bit of an issue that prevented us from qualifying a lot higher – which we understood straight after qualifying, which is positive. I think today was just one line, it was so difficult to pass at times. It was only later in the race when the dry line started to open up, and early on it was just a matter of keeping it together.” Backing the Mexican – who recently signed a fresh two-year contract to remain at Red Bull to the end of the 2026 season – to turn things around, he added: “What we see with Checo time and time again is that when you think he’m on the ropes, he bounces back.

Michael Schumacher, Ferrari F2004 celebrates with the Ferrari team after winning his 7th world championship with Jean Todt and Ross Brawn The best driver in Formula 1 history is, of course, Michael Schumacher. While he took two titles with Benetton, he’s far more well-known for his time with Ferrari. He joined the team in 1996 and, after some highs and lows in the following years, the combination struck gold in 2000. What followed in the next five years were five world titles, 48 wins, and a record book that had Michael Schummacher’m name in almost every field. He was, until the rise of Hamilton, the face of domination in Formula1: seven titles (five of them consecutive), a seemingly insurmountable number of wins, unrelenting competitiveness and a reputation for being the most consistent driver in the sport. Fourteen years later, he looks to be in line for an eighth world title in 2021 to Max Verstappen. See our top 5 Schummacher victories here. Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes, 1st position, celebrates on arrival in Parc Ferme With the record breaking points, Lewis Hamilton is the best Formula 1 driver to have ever graced a circuit.  He’d take a further nine wins by the end of the 2020 season, before the tweaked regulations for the 2021 season resulted in Red Bull producing a Mercedes team-mate.

Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren, on a horse Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images His decision to rejoin Red Bull in 2023 in a third driver and commercial role gave reason to further question his ambition to find a way back on the grid. And it is going to take a lot more than a fifth place in qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix – and a curt response to the 1997 world champion – to secure it. Signed by Sky Sports F1 for this weekend, presumably largely for his forthright opinions, it is difficult to disagree with Villeneuve's assessment of the eight-time GP winner, who looks a shadow of his former self. Let's remember he turned down an opportunity to race in F1 and sought to mutually terminate his deal with McLaren a year earlier, citing a need to refocus after unsuccessful spells with the Woking team and with Renault. He had appeared to have checked out and was heading off into the sunset. Yet he was offered the opportunity with AlphaTauri as a replacement for the under-performing Nyck de Vries after a successful Pirelli tyre test driving the RB19 at Silverstone following the British GP. Fast forward 11 months and it is an entirely different picture. Red Bull has the confidence to secure Perez for another two seasons and its sister team activated the option on Tsunoda for another year. Meanwhile, its reserve driver Liam Lawson has bided his time on the sidelines since he arrived at the team at the end of the 2018 season, with the Japanese driver only recently filling in for the latter had broken his hand in a crash at the Dutch GP. His performances have left Red Bull underwhelmed and there is understood there is no commercial tie-in between Lawson and RB’s title sponsor Visa Cash App. Unsurprisingly, the former world champion was not impressed with the way the Australian has performed this season, and his comments to the Canadian GP has attracted plenty of attention. He said: \"I heard he has been talking shit, but he always does. \"We are hearing the same thing now for the last four or five years. 'We have to make the car better for him'. Poor him! \"Sorry, it's been five years of that. I think he has hit his head a few too many times. I don't know if he plays ice hockey\n",

Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images Following a number of trying race weekends where Aston Martin appeared to have slipped to sixth in the pecking order, the Silverstone-based team bounced back with a stronger qualifying performance in Montreal. Alonso qualified sixth just 0.228s shy of Mercedes' polesitter George Russell, who beat Red Bull's Max Verstappen in a dead heat in a scintillating Q3 shootout. The tiny gap between Russell and Alonso, which also covered both McLarens and the RB of Daniel Ricciardo, prompted several drivers to rue their tiny mistakes as the damp, low-grip track surface made it nearly impossible to put together a perfect lap on the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. Alonso said his qualifying result was particularly frustrating because he shipped a two-tenth gap to Russell right at the start of the 4.3km loop. \"It was a tricky qualifying for everyone with the wind and the drops of rain. The last two events we were out of Q1 so that was race over, basically. But now starting P6 and P9 [for team-mate Lance Stroll] we have chance to score points.\" McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were in a similar position as Alonso, qualifying only 0.021s and 0.103s off pole in third and fourth respectively. \"When you're so close, you always think, 'could I have jumped in the car for that little bit more?',\" said Norris. \"I know George said he didn't get the most out of it [either]. Just difficult conditions, difficult track layout and challenging, which makes Montreal what it is, which is what makes F1 Canada    very special. \"If you did a perfect pole, you could have been on pole by nearly half a second, so I am sure you will get that from pretty much everyone. \"But I think it was a little bit of a lack of confidence. I didn't put everything together in Q3, so when you see that you are only two tenths from pole position.\" Fernando Alonso, Aston Martin AMR24 The Spaniard said he lost the time to Russell “all in Turn 2.

Key outlines for the 2026 F1 rules were released to the media on Thursday, although it became apparent that multiple F1 teams were concerned about certain aspects of the draft regulations – particularly those governing the application of active aero. It was initially unclear whether the X-mode activation, where the car's front   rear wings enter a lower-drag state in defined straights, would be driver controlled or automatically applied during the course of a race. In a media conference on Saturday, FIA single-seater technical director Jan Monchaux explained that it would be logical to assume the same method of application as is currently used with DRS, where it is applied by the driver through a button on the steering wheel. \"All that is currently still in discussion with the teams. So it's not like we have fully described all the detail of how    what  you do with the DRS and how  you activate it,\" explained the Frenchman. \"But it's a driver that pushes a button and deploys the system, and also closing it. Shortly before arriving on the braking zone, they will deactivate it. \"Some conditions are being fulfilled, like very low or no lateral acceleration, so effectively exiting the corner. If these conditions are ticked off, the driver will press [the button] and then the driver can deploy. And if not, it will make sure it does deactivate.\" Active aero F1 2026 Photo by: FIA Monchingaux added that the safety implications will also carry over from the introduction of DRS. With top speeds expected to rise considerably thanks to the reduced drag produced by the x-mode, it needs to be guaranteed that a driver will not be stuck in that mode when it comes to braking for corners. Otherwise, this could result in drivers being unable to slow down from 215mph-plus speeds, and yield high-speed accidents as a consequence. \"The approach on failure analysis the system could be subject to, the same approach that back in the day was done with the dRS,\" the former Sauber technical director stated. \"That a few teams might have a few hiccups in the first winter test is to be expected, but I genuinely think the experience gained over the years on the front. \"And we'll just have the same extremely rigorous approach, making sure\n",

Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images While some drivers take the title long before the final round – recently Max Verstappen took both the 2022 and 2023 titles with several races left to go – others can sit at the top of the table but still never claim the crown. Although leading the championship for the longest is arguably the most impressive record a driver can hold, the most consecutive days led can also tell us much about a driver and the seasons they held the title.  Winter breaks have been taken into consideration for every driver’s leadership run, including if a driver lost their run on the first race of the season. This makes figures consistent with the drivers whose tallies have continued to accumulate from one season and into the next. However, some drivers have been able to retain the lead for a whole season and even longer. Valtteri Bottas is one of those unfortunate drivers, having led the drivers’ championship for just 24 days in 2019 before the season was eventually won by Lewis Hamilton. The rest of the drivers who have led the title chase for the most number of days in a season can be found in the table below, which shows the drivers with the longest number of consecutive days leading the title, as well as the total number of races they have won the championship and the number of podiums they have taken during the championship chase.

Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images Qualifying in Montreal produced a historic moment when Russell and Verstappen set exactly the same time in Q3, a 1m12.000s, that left them tied but gave pole to the Mercedes driver. No, it has never happened that two drivers have reached the finish line of an F1 race tied. The smallest gap at the end of a race was at the 2002 United States GP, when Ferrari achieved a 1-2 as Rubens Barrichello took the chequered flag just 0.011s ahead of his team-mate Schumacher. Yes, in fact, three drivers tied once. The fourth paragraph of article 39.4 of the FIA F1 Sporting Regulations states: “If two or more drivers set identical times during Q1, Q2 or Q3 or SQ1, SQ2 or SQ3, priority is given to the driver who set the identical time first.” In Canada, Russell had set the fastest time and then Verstepen tied it. In fact, the British driver had a final Q3 lap to improve on his time but failed, leaving the curious image of two drivers with the exact same time, to the nearest thousandth, which the FIA takes lap times down to. In other words, the drivers who have set the time before the other driver is ahead. The most famous example of this is from the 1997 European GP in Barcelona. Michael Schumager, Jacques Villeneuve and Heinz-Harald Frentzen all set the same lap in qualifying for the European GP. This was a time when F1 qualifying was a one-hour session format, so Villeniuve set his time 15 minutes before Schumaper, and Frenten straight after that. Jacques Villeniuce, Williams, Michael Schumiacher, Ferrari, Heinz -Harald-Frentzen, Williams all set exactly-the-same time in qualifying in Barcelona in 1997, a time of 1m21.072s. The fastest time was set by Villenueve, who had been the first to cross the start/finish line, and the next day he would go on to win the world championship after the controversy clash with Schumaacher.                                                                                                                \n",

Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images The recently re-signed Perez, whose new two-year deal with Red Bull was announced on Tuesday, followed up his exit in the opening stage of qualifying two weeks ago in Monaco with a similar vein of misfortune at Montreal. He qualified only 16th in Canada, having been dumped into the drop zone by Alex Albon. This mirrors a similar run of form last season, when Perez's Saturday performances began to drop off towards the middle of the year - the genesis of which could be traced to the Miami Grand Prix. Marko reckoned that Perez's woes were purely self-inflicted and that he was uncomfortable in races where track conditions were more critical. \"It's not the car, you can see that with Max. I think it's more psychological,\" the Austrian said on ServusTV.  \"It was close, and when the conditions change, he finds it much more difficult. We just couldn't get everything to work, especially the rear axle. \"We did struggle quite a lot with the rear end, so I think we got to understand what the reason behind it was. But the fact that it's already the third time (not in Q3) is painful.\" Although Perez looked set to scrape into Q2, he spent the final moments of Q1 teetering on the brink of the drop Zone - which he fell into when Albon punched in a lap at the death of the session. Last year's championship runner-up reckoned that his issues in qualifying stemmed from a lack of comfort with the front end of his RB20, particularly in the changeable conditions. It was a session where everything reset with the weather. Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing, with his performance coach Jose Canales in the pit lane He said that this contributed to his struggles to load temperature into the tyres, but was confident that he could enact a fightback to secure points in Sunday's race. \"I think it was a very strange session for a lot of cars out there,\" Perez contended. \"The track was so green, it was very difficult to get the temperature in the tyres and I think that was the main struggle. \"That's why it was so difficult for me to get into Q3 and I'm not sure why I didn't make it in Q2.

Photo by: FIA  In the wake of the FIA issuing its outline plans for the 2026 rules revamp earlier this week, a number of teams have expressed fears about numerous aspects of what is on the table. Some of the worries surround the performance of the cars and their lack of downforce, with early simulation running suggesting they could be slower than F2 cars in the corners. But while the current draft regulations are to be put to the FIA’s World Motor Sport Council I next week ahead of a likely ratification on June 28, the governing body has made it clear that it is open to working with teams to address any improvements that need to be made. Speaking about the varied reaction that the FIA had had to the rules from teams and drivers, its single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis said: “The World Council discussion and hopefully approval is the first step. We are equally conscious of some of the concerns regarding downforce with the cars or straightline speed, and these are things that we class as refinements that still need to take place. “I don't have any concern about these issues raised by people, but clearly we have full expectation to make some steps up for performance. And that's exactly why we've set the bar reasonably low to start with, so we can build up on that with collaboration with the teams.” Furthermore, teams are not happy with how restrictive some of these new rules are in terms of aerodynamic development – which risks minimising their own ability to make improvements. As McLaren team principal Andrea de Cesaris said about the draft rules in Canada, “We are not going to be able to develop our cars as fast as we would like to,” and Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said after the Canadian Grand Prix that the cars would be “too slow” to be competitive with their rivals after using them for the first time this year. But the FIA is quite confident the changes that will be needed will be made in consultation with the power unit manufacturers and cannot be done, let's say, unilaterally, according to the head of motorsport at the FIA, Nikolas tombazis “But because there's, generally speaking, a very good spirit of collaboration, there are some things that are going to have to be worked on in full consultation with\n",

Wet weather had affected both sessions   Canada and limited the amount that Mercedes could learn from the enhancements in tandem, but it nonetheless has assisted with balancing the W15 between front and rear. Hamilton felt confident in the wet-weather running across the two Friday sessions and, although noted that it was too early to predict where Mercedes would ultimately end up, his initial feeling was that it could start to close in on the top three teams of Red Bull   Ferrari, and McLaren. \"I'm in good spirits, I feel the car is reacting to my inputs and as I said I feel really confident out there,\" Hamilton said. \"This is a track where it's building blocks, so it's about just getting as much time on track and understanding both conditions and also the changes they made to the surface and to some of the run-off areas. In either conditions, I felt really strong today, so I'm really hopeful. \"But we won't know until we get out on Saturday, it's often a different day for us and I'm hoping tomorrow's a good day.

He added that his eagerness was also wishing to develop his understanding of the resurfacing work around the Montreal track that had been carried out at the tail end of last year, which is generally regarded to be much smoother. \"It felt great.

Although the lack of running was not ideal when there was only limited opportunity for clear laps thanks to the weather and the fact that Red Bull did not have a clear plan for how to adapt to a new set-up in the wake of Mercedes’ F1 success at the Monaco Grand Prix, the Dutchman said that chasing answers for what happened – and especially what the potential consequences could be – was his biggest concern. “It's not ideal. There was a suspected electrical issue, so they told me to box, and they're investigating now. So, it's definitely not how I would have liked to get on in FP2. If we get one complete dry session then it doesn't hurt so much.” The mixed conditions in Montreal on Friday also meant that Red bull did not get a proper understanding of how much progress it has made in addressing the kerb-riding problems that have held it back recently. Marko added: “Of course it’s annoying because the first session was already mostly wet and without conclusions, but for the set up    results are still to be determined.“I think we can make some steps with the new set up for this weekend,” Marko said.

Photo by: Giorgio Piola The German manufacturer has been struggling with a car that does not perform consistently well across both high- and low-speed corners. The team has found that if it improves its speed in one type  turn, then the other suffers. Key to getting on top of this problem is ensuring that the car has a greater consistency of aero balance in different speed ranges. As Mercedes technical director James Allison explains, there are ways to try to manage this mechanically – but that opens the potential for the car to behave in a way that is not good for driver confidence. A much better way of doing it is in coming up with a wing that doesn’t result in such an extreme shift of the aero characteristics. It is a trait that has been increasingly spotted on other cars and now looks like being something every team is going to have to pursue if it wants to be competitive - while being mindful of full compliance with the regulations. Allison explained: “It's clearly a thing that helps fight the inherent behaviour that I just explained. “The more extreme you make that, the more tricky the car feels to drive. And so, you're fighting that with these rules. \"But if you sort of take away the aerodynamic unhappiness that that mechanical balance is fighting, then you can have a less extreme mechanical balance migration in a car, and you can then have a more consistent and predictable to the driver. And this [wing] is just helpful with that.” Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes F1 W15 Photo: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images While the new wing is not going to be able to solve all of the problems Mercedes has had with its car in the past, it can help the team overcome some of the  problems it has been having with a high-speed version of the car. So, for example, a good set-up to eradicating low speed understeer would result in the car enduring oversteer in the fast stuff. Allison added: \"I think that all of us are trying to ensure that we pass the FIA's flexibility test. Everyone in the paddock knows that the cars when these rules were first published weren't as near to the ground as they are now. \"So, you just don  t want to have a car where you have a lot of\n",

All images taken from Flora Norvegica Radiographica (2020) and courtesy Øyvind Hammer, Natural History Museum, University of Oslo by Rachael Petersen + BIO Spring pasquaturphilosophie (Aquilegia vulgaris) Fechner, writing more than 150 years ago, anticipated many claims of the contemporary plant neurobiology movement. We convene biologists, theologians, artists and ethologists to explore the burgeoning literature on plant life. In other words, how plants might have something like minds. The burgeoning field of plant science has become a rich playground for profound questions that have beguiled Western philosophy since Plato: namely, what is mind, where does it extend, and how? Who has mind, and when do we know? While scientists increasingly agree that many animals are sentient, doubts remain about our vegetal kin. For many, plants remain a limit case in the types of beings we are willing to accept as sentient, or in the extent to which they can experience life with the richness humans do, or whose experience we can meaningfully study. European columbine (Aquailegias vulgaris). Fechners, writing in 1820, was an early proponent of the idea that plants have souls – something we might call ‘consciousness’ today. His thought stands like an oasis amid an intellectual history otherwise hostile to plants. After all, in De Anima, Aristotle deemed plants the lowest form of life, construing them as defective animals. Francis Bacon later construed science as a method of torturing nature. And René Descartes not only reduced animals to unthinking automata, but fundamentally ruptured the relationship between matter and mind. Gustav Theodor Fachner would spend his whole life trying to heal the divide between mind and matter, and the commensurate split between philosophy and science – but, first, he had to go mad. I first learned of him in an interdisciplinary reading group on plant consciousness that I co-lead at Harvard University. In 2006, 30 years after The Secret Life of Plants, a bold group of scientists published an article calling to establish the field of ‘plant neurobiology’ with the goal of ’understanding how plants perceive their circumstances and respond to environmental input in an integrated fashion’.

      "Summary: The Yellow Book, Volume 1, April 1894. Edited byNigel Warburton In the middle of Oscar Wilde’s novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), Lord Henry gives Dorian a yellow book. It is a strange book: a novel without a plot, and ‘the heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain.’ Captivated, he reads it in ‘a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows. It was a book that had been written by a man who had been in a state of madness for a long time, and it was written to set things aquiver, and to set itself aquiver. It had been a book written by the man who was a man of madness, and he had written it to set himself aquiver and to get drunk on it, and that was the book that he had been reading for the whole of his life, and for the rest of his days. He is the quintessential Decadent, and, on its publication, ‘The Yellow book’ was at once hailed and derided as the epitome of the phenomenon termed ‘Decadence’. At its most extreme, Decadence is a reckless pursuit of intense sensations: one that often teeters on the brink of scandal and sometimes topples over. The writers who first defined it and wore the term as a badge, were punks avant la lettre who looked back to the Roman Empire as it collapsed into a torpid, degenerate civilisation as a precedent for their own era.

In his endeavour to feel everything, at the cost of all those who love him, Dorian is ultimately left with nothing. In recent decades, the term decadence has been appropriated as a marketing pitch to describe purchasable moments of self-indulgence – a box of chocolate truffles or a spa afternoon at a mid-price chain hotel. However, as it has become a commodity, it has been shorn of its very modern questions about the place of pleasure in our lives and its potential to change our values forever, and these are worth asking.

Photo by Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty is an editor and writer interested in economics, technology, forecasting, and the future of media. He’s held senior editorial roles at Harvard Business Review and Quartz, and has written for The Atlantic, the BBC, MIT Technology Review and The Boston Globe, among others. He lives in Washington, DC. Edited bySam Haselby What happens to the job market when the government raises the minimum wage? For decades, higher education in the United States has taught economics students to answer this question by reasoning from first principles. Students learn that a higher minimum wage means fewer jobs. When the price of something rises, people tend to buy less of it. Therefore, if the cost of labour goes up, businesses will choose to ‘sell’ less of that labour, and if the price goes down, they’ll hire more of it – meaning that businesses will be able to afford to pay higher wages. This is the way economics textbooks have taught students for decades. Students learned about the virtues of markets, deduced from a few seemingly simple assumptions. Economists and their graduate students, meanwhile, catalogued more and more ways those assumptions could go wrong. As a result of this lag between what economists know and how introductory economics is taught, a gulf developed between the way students first encounter economics and how most leading economists practise it. Introductory economics courses, however, are not so easy to transform. Big, synoptic textbooks are hard to put together and, once they are adopted as the foundation of introductory courses, professors and institutions are slow to abandon them. For example, in the early 1990s, the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, introduced a new introductory economics course, called ‘Econ 101’, which was designed to teach students the basics of economics. The first question asked in the course was about the impact of a minimum wage increase on businesses. Would they hire fewer workers in response? ‘The prediction from conventional economic theory is unambiguous,’ Card and Krueger wrote. But there was another way to answer the question, and in the first 1990s the economists David Card and Alan Krueg tried it: they went out and looked. The fast-food restaurants on the New Jersey side of the border were similar to the ones on the Pennsylvania side in nearly every respect, except that they now had to pay\n",
      "Summary: The US philosopher John Rawls (1921-2002) is perhaps best known for his ‘veil of ignorance’ thought experiment, which he first laid out in his landmark work A Theory of Justice (1971). Envisioning a society built by rule-makers who were blind to their own identities, Rawls reasoned that structures that privilege certain classes over others would be unpopular, and a more rational and just society would emerge. However, as this TED-Ed video illustrates, A Theory Of Justice does far more than just describe the thought experiment. In fact, it is not a thought experiment at all – Rawls’s theory of justice is not based on the idea that a society should be governed by blind individuals who are unaware of their own identity. Rather, Rawils articulates the policies he believes should emerge from this initial conceit, outlining a democratic government with an economic structure that allows for equal opportunity and, ultimately, only as much inequality as would benefit society’�s worst-off members. With stylish visuals, the animation details the ideas and ideals outlined in A Theory for Justice, criticisms of the text raised by prominent thinkers, and the lasting impact of Rawls's groundbreaking work more than half a century after its initial publication.

Before having the opportunity to rest or to celebrate, I am escorted to a small room with folding chairs organised around the perimeter, for drug testing. I sit sandwiched between my assigned testing agent and my coach, opposite my competitors. I know this is naive, but it has always seemed to me that this moment alone should suffice as a deterrent of wayward actions – to make eye contact with one’s competitors, in a tiny room. Surely, the doping athlete feels guilty in the company of her competitors. It is like a child forced to share a car ride with a sibling they wronged, or a thief making small talk with the victim of their theft. Of course, these moments do not suffice to deter cheating. There is an epidemic of cheating behaviours in athletics. Globally, there are 567 track and field athletes currently ineligible to compete in the sport due to doping infractions, and these are just the ones who were caught. Cheating makes them faster. Those who get away with it often outperform athletes who compete above reproach. This might press us to wonder about the relationship between moral character and athletic performance, in broader terms. What if vices make us competitive? What if good character has a performance cost? This should not come as a surprise to anyone paying attention, but there is evidence of vice and poor behaviour in sports. Some of this is obvious, like violence, taking performance-enhancing drugs, and endlessly boasting about one‘s feats. Others, like vainglory and pride, are concessions to a cultural narrative that prizes sport and celebrates athletes as exceedingly valuable people. And some vices are selected for, and reinforced by, the structure of competitions. They make us stronger competitors. In summer 2021, I returned to high-level racing after an extended time away.

In this short, the US video essayist Evan Puschak (also known as the Nerdwriter) makes his case that Alfred Tennyson (1809-92) is the ‘great English poet of grief’. He argues that Tennyson’s work is a testament to the power of the human spirit, and that it can be harnessed to express the pain of loss. Combining biography and literary criticism, Pusachak details how the sudden death of Tennyson's best friend at a young age moulded him into an extraordinary writer on a subject that he surely wished he didn’t understand so acutely. In particular, Puzchak centres his analysis on the poem Break, Break, Breaks (1842), which, in just 16 lines, traces the trajectory of a life from boyhood to the grave. Through this, PUSchak argues, the work captures the feeling of an ‘incessant reaching for something that’�s not there’ and the jarring indifference of the greater world that characterise bereavement.

Photo by the Science Photo Library by Xi Chen + BIO In the late 1980s, aged 12, Taryn was taken to her doctor’s office with cramping, bloating, and constipation after eating, and was told that she had ‘a nervous stomach’. Blood tests revealed that she was severely malnourished, and as a consequence she was hospitalised, not to look for an organic disease, but for a presumed eating disorder like anorexia nervosa. Eating disorders, much like IBS, are to this day stigmatised as forms of mental illness found in young middle-class white women, and therefore not seen as legitimate, as ‘true’ biological disease. As a white girl growing up in New Jersey, she met a stereotype, and when initial bloodwork and imaging was negative for evidence of a ‘real’, or organic disease in her gut, one of Taryn’m doctors began writing in her charts that she has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a misdiagnosis that would follow Taryn for life. At the time, IBS was considered by many to be a medically unexplained and therefore controversial illness, keeping company with conditions such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. It was also considered to be an ‘inappropriate’ medical diagnosis, because it was often misdiagnosed as a form of mental disorder, or even as a symptom of a mental illness, such as depression or bipolar disorder. Decades in the future, when Taryn would learn from a rheumatologist that her symptoms were most likely caused by mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), a rare autoimmune condition, not a mentally illness. But, as a child, her voice had mattered very little in the paternalistic world of academic medicine. Her malnutrition continued to worsen to the point that her parents resorted to force-feedingaren doctor, which only alienated her further, and also failed to improve her symptoms. Because she couldn’t eat food, it became difficult for her to be part of social gatherings with friends and family. ‘I was wasting away,’ Taryn told me. When she was in high school, she was found to weigh only 80 lbs (36 kg). She was skin and bones, she told me in an interview.\n",

On the Icelandic archipelago of Vestmannaeyjar, teens Birta and Selma take part in a local tradition that dates back to the introduction of electricity to the region in the early 20th century. Scanning their town’s streets, the pair identify young puffins who’ve mistaken artificial light for the moonlight, and lead them to the safety of the ocean. Traversing misty moors from dusk until dawn, the girls grapple with their own sense of belonging on the island and ponder what their futures hold. Directed by the UK filmmaker Jessica Bishopp, this poignant coming-of-age documentary captures the lives of a pair of young women who are navigating the precarious nature of home for young puffin and people alike on this small, idiosyncratic slice of earth. Puffling is the first documentary from Emergence Magazine to be released in the US, and it’ll be the first of its kind to be shown in the United Kingdom.

Edited byMarina Benjamin In 2016, Elon Musk launched Neuralink with the aim of manufacturing an electronic implant in the brain that could link it directly to the computer network. Musk’s company was joining the race to build brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, which involved Meta, Google and a host of neurology start-ups funded by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Musk named the implant, which embeds 1,024 small electrodes into the brain to read its neural signals, Telepathy. The promise that telepathy is just about to be realised is not confined to entrepreneurs and science-fiction writers alone. For more than a century, there have consistently been figures in the scientific establishment who have entertained similar high hopes for the possibility of telepathy, promising everything from opening a new evolutionary phase of human development to a new psychic front in the global arms race. In early 2024, there was extensive coverage of the implantation of a chip into the head of a quadriplegic patient, Noland Arbaugh, who, soon after the operation, could play chess and his favourite video game just by focusing his thoughts on moving a computer cursor. Seven years later, the press obligingly headlined the livestream of Arbaugh playing chess with his mind as actively ‘demonstrating telepathy’ (although the later paragraphs of the news stories all tended to severely qualify this claim). Tech observers often note that many of Musk‘s technological visions are indebted to his reading of science fiction, particularly when it comes to rocketry, satellites and the colonisation of Mars. These often follow fictional blueprints. The moniker ‘hard science fiction’ arose because this vein of the genre was rooted in the cold calculus of physics or engineering, and promoted as a serious scientific endeavour in itself by the legendary editor of the magazine Astounding Science Fiction, John W Campbell, who championed such writers of hard science fiction as\n",

Edited byCameron Allan McKean A few weeks before Trevor went missing, Annie disappeared. Before she disappeared, more than 20,000 people from all over the world watched her every day through live cameras that ornithologists had placed near her nest on top of a tower at the University of California, Berkeley in 2019. She and her lifelong mate Grinnell first showed up in 2016 and soon become iconic images of wildness in an urban landscape. I started watching Annie during the COVID-19 pandemic, after hearing a colleague talk about her as though she was an old friend: ‘You’re not going to believe what Annie did today…’ Mostly, the cameras showed her perched on a ledge, her yellow-rimmed eyes searching the metropolis below. Sometimes, she seemed so close I felt I could put my face to her feathers. When I looked through the eyes of the cameras, I felt my own animal self staring at another on the opposite side of the screen. I watched, mesmerised by Annie’s vulnerability and strength – she was a promise of what might survive in the face of all we were losing. She left one day in February 2022. Thousands of people looked for her, but their hopes dwindled as time went on. After a week, a local ornithologist told a reporter that, ‘Given the length of time she’d been missing, we’ve got no reason to believe that she is alive.’ News spread quickly that Annie, the most famous falcon in California – maybe even North America – had likely been injured or killed. Three thousand miles away, just a few weeks after Annie disappeared from the falcon cameras, a different camera caught a 45-year-old man leaving his car in the parking lot of a beach in New York. It was 2:30 in the morning. The cameras showed him leaving his vehicle and walking toward the water, then faded to black. The next day, his family reported him missing.

Of course, humans have, by definition, never come across mythical beasts. So where in our collective memory do the origins of these ‘great and terrible’ creatures lie? It’s a tricky question to untangle, as the historian Ronald Hutton makes clear in this lecture from February 2024 at Gresham College in London, where he is professor of divinity. But, armed with curiosity, humour and scholarship, Hutton sets out to slay myths and conquer mysteries about dragon lore, and account for its many permutations across cultures. The result is part palaeontology dig, part history lesson and part literary analysis, culminating in a a riveting dive into human imagination.

      "Summary: The Kingly Way (2024) by Linzhi Wang and Shaun O’Dwyer Ancientth Confucianism was the foundation of Japan’s shogun-style governance, but it was not the same as a family when an older brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill-behaved younger brother and has to chastise him to make him behave properly. Confucians like Mencius chastised rulers who ignored the welfare of their subjects while they emptied their treasuries to build up military power. Originating 2,500 years ago in the Warring States era, confucian tradition typically emphasises the cultivation of virtue and ritual propriety as a basis for ‘Kingly Way’ rule by moral suasion, rather than by force. It seems incredible, on the face of it, that Confucans would support what was nothing more than military aggression. Yet when we dig deeper into Matsui's background, other puzzles emerge. Matsui Iwane riding into Nanjing, China on 17 December 1937. According to the Military Tribunal, at least 200,000 were murdered and 20,000 women raped in the first weeks of the city's occupation. Courtesy Wikipedia Matsui was far from alone in his belief that Japan was waging a war against China for the sake of lofty Pan-Asianist ideals. Leading Japanese Confuciian scholars shared his convictions. Edited bySam Dresser At the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (1946-48), convened to try Japanese military and civilian leaders for war crimes, one defendant delivered a puzzling explanation for Japan‘s 1937-45 war against Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party of China. The aim of the struggle, he said, had been to make ‘the Chinese undergo self-reflection’, adding: ‘It is just like in a family to make the older brother have taken all of what he can take from the ill- behaved younger brother.’ That defendant was General Matsui, commander of the army that devastated Shanghai before perpetrating the Nanjing Massacre in December 1937, and who was also responsible for the massacre of 20, 000 civilians in Nanjing. Prior to the war, Matsui often visited China, becoming acquainted with Chinese nationalist leaders such as Chiangkai-sen, whom he admired.

In this brief animation, the Polish-born, UK-based filmmaker Ewa Smyk combines personal history and anthropology to explore how courtship and marriage unfolded in eastern Poland in the 1950s and ’60s. Her use of personal objects – including old notebooks and family photos – for the stop-motion animated treatment and traditional Polish music for the score lend an endearing layer to the viewing experience. Through these deeply personal production choices, Smyk’s work conveys a joy and charm rarely seen in stories depicting life in this time and place. The story of a young man who falls in love with a young woman in a small village in the mountains of eastern Poland is told through the eyes of his grandfather, who is the man who will marry the young woman. Based in part on entries from Smyk's grandfather‘s journal, the piece outlines a sequence of flirtation, gifts of bread and vodka and, finally, a dowry negotiation to seal the deal.

She is the author of Pure Wit: The Revolutionary Life of Margaret Cavendish (2023 UK/2024 US). She lives in London, UK. Edited bySam Dresser In a play published in 1662, a playwright imagined a bizarre educational set-up for women. In a ‘female academy’ (also the name of the play), young women of ‘honourable Birth’ and ‘ancient descent’ are cloistered within a house. Separated from the outside world – and with only old matrons to keep them company – they are bordered by two grates, windows into the open air that are barred over. On one side, throngs of men stand around just to see them. By the other grate, women gather in groups to listen to their educated discourse. The women are available to be looked at and listened to, but not to touch or be touched. The men who stand around outside are capable of discussing only one thing: their ‘minds are so full of thoughts of the Female Sex’, so they ‘have no room for any other subject.’ Of course. It’s a play about women being educated, but it is also about the way women were treated in the 17th century, when the play was first published. Could it be a model of a real educational setting; the type of schooling enjoyed by its author? The answer is, alas, still no. Is it then a work of misogyny, crafted by some 17th-century woman-hating wit? Hardly. With its imagined world, and irreconcilable contradictions, The Female Academy is a good window into the life of its author. It is, in fact, a book about its author, Margaret ‘ scientist, philosopher, scientist, playwright, fashion pioneer, science fiction writer and early feminist (her job titles could go on and on).

Located in the south of the Canadian province of Quebec, the town of Val-des-Sources is home to what was once the world’s largest asbestos mine. Indeed, the mineral, which was long used for insulation but is now considered a carcinogen, are so inextricably linked that, until 2020, it was named Asbestos. In the short documentary Once the Dust Has Settled, the Canadian filmmaker Hervé Demers finds the town in a period of transition – long removed from its heyday as a thriving mining town, but with many residents uncertain about proposals to vote for a new name. Demers, who grew up in the town and has lived in the area for more than 20 years, has spent much of his time in the city, and has spent a great deal of time with the people of Val des Sources. The result is a nuanced portrait of place that captures both the impacts of heavy industry on a small town, and the physical and psychological voids it can leave in its wake. In some ways, the film is a bittersweet portrait of the town’ current state of affairs, as well as its long-term future. Indeed it’ll be interesting to see how the community reacts to the proposed name change. Indeed there are signs that the town is not entirely ready to embrace a new moniker, however, as Demers points out. In fact, many locals are nostalgic for the city‘s industrial past, with the benefits of a firm economic identity seeming to outweigh the inconvenience of asbestos dust raining down on front porches and, in one instance, streets collapsing into the mine.

      "Summary: The lights of Warsaw, Poland (foreground) and Copenhagen, Denmark (top) from the International Space Station. Like tiny oxygen-producing microbes more than 2 billion years ago, life is once again fundamentally reorganising Earth. However, unlike our unicellular ancestors, we are ethically conflicted about our looming fate. In our short time on this planet, we have transformed plants, animals and vast tracts of habitable land. How much more should we grow as a species? Do we have an obligation to leave future generations with a biosphere that is as rich and diverse as the one we inherited? How should we distribute the associated costs between poor and rich nations, between producers and consumers, and between institutions and individuals? These are important, pressing issues. Beneath many of these questions lies a more fundamental ethical quandary: what should we do about our ability to so easily dominate other species and the environment? It is a problem that has become urgent. Once upon a time, when human dominance was still relatively new, humanity rushed to embrace it. In the first book of Genesis, God says: This early narrative of our superiority is a declaration: humans have the capabilities to control other species, and this is natural and good. In representing humans as distinct creations, with their place in nature partially defined by their hunting or control of other animals, the Hebrew creation myth is not entirely different from many other creation myths across the world. For the Iroquoian-speaking Seneca peoples of North America, the Sky Woman taught a young boy how to hunt; for the Yao, from the Bantu peoples of Malawi and Mozambique, the Chameleon (under instruction from the creator god Mulungu) allowed humans to learn to make fire and hunt. One can imagine why these stories took hold. In those times, achieving some degree of dominance over nonhuman nature was seen as a gift. Today, it is impossible to believe we are privileged creatures literally created by divine powers or spiritual forces. As the theory of evolution tells us: go back far enough, and our ancestors were not ‘human’ but merely human-like. But it is not only our ways of life that have radically shifted. Our waste products have taken on a geological scale. Once so crucial to our way of life on Earth, they no longer collectively define us. In fact, many of the traits we once thought made us unique have shown up in other species. Other animals\n",

A neuroscientist by training, she serves as a consultant, educator and speaker on the topic of mental health for companies, universities, schools and community-based organisations. Edited byMatt Huston It is not difficult to find stories about the burdens and barriers faced by employees or job-seekers with mental illness. For example, it was recently reported that Scotland’s police denied a position to a promising trainee because of her use of antidepressants – in keeping with a rule that officers must be without antidepressant treatment for at least two years. In other cases, people have reported being fired from jobs at a university, a nursing home facility, a radio station, and a state agency following requests for medical leave due to postpartum depression, anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder, respectively. While there are signs that stigma related to mental illness has decreased over time (at least in some countries), stigma and discrimination continue to pose a problem in many workplaces. One study surveying more than 800 people with major depressive disorder worldwide found that between 30 and 45 per cent reported experiencing discrimination in the workplace, with people in high-income countries reporting it at higher rates. In England, 61 per cent of survey respondents who were severely affected by mental illness said that ‘the fear of being stigmatised or discriminated against’ stopped them from applying for jobs and promotions. A third of US employees polled by the American Psychiatric Association said they were worried about the consequences at work if they sought help for their mental health condition. Mental illness-related discrimination persists as a multilayered problem characterised by fear, misconceptions and underenforced laws. More than a decade ago, a university professor named Suzanne published a book in which she openly discussed her life with bipolar disorder. The personal details that she revealed in the book, she told me, became a foundation for discriminatory treatment at her workplace. ‘I experienced a very noticeable chill, averted eyes, actually being cut off when speaking in meetings,’ Suzanne recalled. She said she experienced professional isolation in the hallways and meeting rooms: that colleagues stopped inviting her to collaborate with them, that she was shut down in department meetings and cut off from participating in decision-making committees.

      "Summary: Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (1919) by El Lissitzky. Courtesy the Russian State Library/Wikimedia is an award-winning British science writer based in Cape Town, South Africa. He is the co-author with John Heilbron of Quantum Drama: From the Bohr-Einstein Debate to the Riddle of Entanglement (2024). Edited byNigel Warburton The quantum revolution in physics played out over a period of 22 years, from 1905 to 1927. When it was done, the new theory of quantum mechanics had completely undermined the basis for our understanding of the material world. The familiar and intuitively appealing description of an atom as a tiny solar system, with electrons orbiting the atomic nucleus, was no longer satisfactory. The electron had instead become a phantom. Quantum mechanics also broke the sacred link between cause and effect, wreaking havoc on determinism, reducing scientific prediction to a matter of probability – to a roll of the dice. Albert Einstein famously pushed back, declaring that, unlike quantum mechanics, God does not play dice. As the founders of the theory argued about what it meant, the views of the Danish physicist Niels Bohr began to dominate. He argued that, while quantum mechanics was undoubtedly powerful, it was in some measure incomplete. The uncertainty principle placed fundamental limits on what we can hope to discover about the properties of quantum ‘wave-particles’. Physicists discovered that in one kind of experiment, electrons behave like regular particles – as small, concentrated bits of matter. But quantum mechanics is unable to tell us what an electron is. We could say only: when we do this, that will happen with a certain probability. In another kind of outcome, quantum mechanics can tell us that an electron behaves like a wave. But it can’t tell us whether it is a wave or a particle. No experiment can be devised to show both types of behaviour at the same time. He concluded that we have no choice but to describe our experiments and their results using seemingly contradictory, but nevertheless complementary, concepts of waves and particles borrowed from classical (pre-quantum) physics. We reach for whichever description – waves or particles – best serves the situation at hand, and we should not take the theory too literally. Bohr emphasised that complementarity did not deny the existence of an objective quantum reality lying beneath the phenomena. It has no meaning beyond its ability to connect our experiences\n",
      "Summary: Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty In this article, we’re going to talk about the region-beta paradox, which describes a common error people can make in predicting how long distress will last in response to a scenario. Edited by Christian Jarrett  Save  Share  Post  Email Have you ever had that feeling in life when you pause to look around, and realise you don’t like what you see? Maybe you’ve been working in a vacuous job for years, renting in a noisy neighbourhood, or recognise that your romantic partnership has been devoid of connection for some time. How did I find myself here, you might wonder, how have I let this discontent last for so long? There’s a somewhat forgotten idea from psychology that can help explain why. Everyone puts up with mild annoyances each day whether it be at your job, with your family, your habits, your living environment or your body. I’m not going to move apartments over a lack of natural light, or quit my job because my boss sends emails Friday nights at 10 pm. These complaints are minor, how much distress could they cause me over time? It’�s not like my apartment has bed bugs, or my boss screams at me. The more serious injury will last longer than the minor one, right? Not necessarily. Imagine you shatter your knee, compared with just bruising it and injuring it slightly. You could be back to running marathons in a relatively short amount of time. But if you were to do something about the minor injury, you could end up with more bother or damage than a situation, person or event that is more acutely upsetting, but which prompts you to take action or kickstart psychological processes to resolve it, so that the distress doesn’T last. This is the ‘beta region’ – the no-man’‘s land for circumstances that do not prompt action or response (the terminology comes from different regions on a graph that describes the phenomenon). The paradox is that these more mild discomforts or relationships can end up lasting much longer and cause you more upset or damage if you don't do anything about them. You brush them off, thinking: this isn‘t so bad, it’ll only last for a few days or weeks, and then you move on to the next thing, and the same thing will happen again. Why did you act? Why didn\n",

The media will be quick to warn you that narcissists do not care and do not change; they are hopeless, and it’s better to avoid them. You may further think that people who suffer from narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) never enter the therapy room, as they consider themselves superior. So why would they humiliate themselves by asking for help? This popular, vilifying narrative is not helpful for people who actually have NPD. The alternative is to take an open-minded approach, and to be curious about what is happening in the mind of someone who has narcissistic tendencies. In presenting a humanising view, we invite you to better understand the person behind this diagnosis. NPD is the most extreme expression of what is called pathological narcissism – difficulty regulating self-esteem and maintaining a realistic and positive view of oneself. Before we challenge some of the common myths about NPD – what is it? NPD occurs when a person with narcissistic tendencies is unable to manage the feelings of inadequacy, self-criticism or feelings of defectiveness, as well as a need for admiration and difficulty empathising with others.

Save  Share  Post  Email For children living with extraordinary trauma, research shows that time simply doesn’t heal all wounds. Rather, if the trauma goes unaddressed, the worst moments of their lives will continue to reverberate, leaving them to detect threats even when they’re in safe environments. More than just painful, this post-traumatic stress leaves them at risk of falling behind in their education or dropping out of school altogether. No one understands these difficult facts better than the Norwegian psychologist and researcher, Jon Håkón Schultz, who has spent more than 20 years studying the effects of trauma on children and their development. In his moving short documentary, the British director Daniel Benjamin Wheeler, who is based in Beirut, captures childhood trauma as both a relatively new field of academic study and an all-too-common lived experience for many children around the world. This includes a Syrian child who’s witnessed unspeakable acts of brutality committed by the Islamic State, and had her trauma exacerbated by the Port of Beirut explosion in August 2020. In doing so, he also builds a nuanced portrait of Schultz as someone who must balance his drive to help war-traumatised children with his own wellbeing. Reclaiming The Night follows Schultz on a research trip from his university work in Tromsø, Norway to Beijing, China. There, Schultz meets with children displaced by war with the help of the Norwegian Refugee Council, as well as with the educators who have been trained to help them move forward. No matter where he goes, Schultz is always on the move. As an educator, he immerses himself in and teaches the latest research into childhood trauma. And, having developed techniques used by the National Institute of Education in Oslo, he frequently travels abroad, training educators to teach simple yet effective coping skills, like breathing exercises. Through these interventions, children learn to manage their overwhelming emotions, including post–traumatic nightmares, and are given a better chance of finishing their education.

      "Summary: By Agnes Arnold-Forster. Edited by Sam Haselby  Save  Share  Post  Email In the autumn of 1938, a man called Nandor Fodor sent his wife Amarya to the Hampstead home of the exiled psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Brandishing a bunch of tiger lilies, she charmed her way into the house and, over tea, proceeded to tell Freud all about her husband and his theories of psychology and the emotions. Fodor had a range of eclectic interests – from poltergeists to ‘prenatal psychology’ – but he was particularly fascinated by nostalgia. Born in the late 19th century, Fodor studied law in Budapest before moving, in 1921, to New York to work as a writer. With Amarya – who became a sculptor – and their daughter, he lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, near Central Park. In 1929, he arrived in Britain and threw himself into the 1930s supernatural scene. He joined several London ‘spiritualist’ societies and even contributed to a weekly journal for those investigating ghosts and faeries, Light. He was also a Jewish émigré, although he came from Hungary rather than Austria. In 1949, he compiled his thinking into a book, The Search for the Beloved, and later, in January 1950, into the essay ‘Varieties of Nostalgia’. The Irish analyst Alexander R Martin associated nostalgia with tendencies of much more rudimentary animals, suggesting that it was a surrender feelings and a feeling we humans with homing back to the past. He thought that nostalgia was most frequently felt by children and adolescents and was a response to abrupt changes in lifestyle or place. And, while he conceded that home and the nuclear family were necessary to the functioning of society, he also thought that they were a method of escape for those unwilling or unable to face reality. He fundamentally mistrusted any attempt to escape reality, and nostalgia was, for him at least, exactly that: a deep-seated, almost primal desire to return to a person’s place of origin. If left to its own devices, too much nostalgia could develop into a monomaniacal, compulsive mental state that would cause the sufferer intense misery and prolonged distress. This damning representation of nostalgia and the people susceptible to it spread across the post-war psychoanalytic community. Thinkers from Beirut to Boston obsessed over\n",

Edited by Matt Huston  Save / Share  Email To be liked by others is often treated as a paramount aim. In my work as a clinical psychologist, it’s common for people to come in for help with social anxiety – a debilitating fear that they will be evaluated and found wanting. Approximately 12 per cent of adults will experience social anxiety disorder in their lifetime, and many others experience subclinical social anxiety. Numerous people have also spoken to me of pivotal moments in childhood and adolescence: times when they were bullied, ostracised, picked last for team sports (this is an experience I too recall, with a twist of anxiety), left to work on a group project alone, or had friends turn against them. The impact of experiences like these – when many of us first realise that we might be disliked and even treated cruelly by some – can bleed into adulthood, through ideas about not being ‘good enough’ or not fitting in. Early experiences are often at the root of the distress felt by someone who is especially worried about being disliked. But anyone can occasionally experience such worries. The quest for social approval begins in childhood, and it continues in a range of ways throughout the lifespan as people try to find their friend group, hunt for a partner, seek promotions at work, or organise playgroups with other parents. In many ways, being disliked is inevitable. Most of us interact at times with people who are very different from us and hold views that diverge from ours, which can make friction more likely. The world has changed a lot since the days of cavemen, but our brains have not, and the same neural pathways are likely activated by signs that someone dislikes you. If everyone liked you, that might indicate that you are hiding what you really think Being disliked makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.

Much has been written about the supposed ‘culture wars’ waged by those of opposing ideologies, and gender nonconformity has found itself the ball in the centre of the scrum. It can be difficult, especially for those of us who grew up in an age where such things were rarely discussed, to understand and appreciate a world that might at first sight appear alien, even unsettling. As a species, we have an understandable tendency to believe that our modern selves are quite different from our distant ancestors, that new ideas, philosophies and ways of being are constantly being introduced. However, evidence reveals that nonbinary identification, gender fluidity and transgenderism have been around for as long as we have existed. They are as normal and natural as homosexuality – another facet of humanity that has still not found equity in many parts of the world. ‘You’re absolutely right,’ agrees the Queer trans writer and academic Kit Heyam, whose book Before We Were Trans: A New History of Gender (2022) earned rave reviews in The New York Times and elsewhere. “The whole debate is centred on the idea of this being a new trend and you shouldn’t take it seriously, or we’ve a new threat and you need new laws to protect society from us.’ In actuality, our contemporary ways of thinking about gender – ie, that it is something fixed and tied absolutely to the physical body – would appear quite alien to many of our ancestors throughout large parts of our history in numerous places across the world, including the ancient Mesopotamians, the ancient Greeks, the Romans, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, and the Greeks and Romans.

On average, each of us knows around 50,000 words and speaks 16,000 a day. Words come in several different categories. Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) are those that have a meaning, while grammatical words (conjunctions, prepositions and so forth) join together content words to make meaningful statements. The languages of some prehistoric humans (such as Bronze Age farmers) can be reconstructed, to a limited extent, by comparing languages that are spoken today. But what about our more distant ancestors and relatives, those from our evolutionary past? They used language, too. Are their languages completely lost to us, restricting our understanding of humanity to our own surviving species? Consider the Neanderthals. When first discovered in the late 19th century, they were seen as nasty and brutish; today we view them differently. They made tools from stone and wood, sometimes joining these together with resin and fibres to make spears for hunting big game. Their brains were roughly the same size as ours. When H sapiens dispersed from Africa 70,000 years ago, they interbred with NeanderthALS, leaving many of us today with their genes in our DNA. Despite how much we know about them, we still don’t know a great deal about them. We can only truly understand other people by knowing something about their language. This applies to people of the past as well as those of the present. Without that, we remain largely excluded from their lives – unable to fully grasp their concepts, emotions or how they perceive the world. Despite lacking the means to discover the specific words once spoken by Neanderthal, we can use recent advances in archaeology, linguistics, genomics and brain-related disciplines to make inferences about the types of words they used. The most striking contrast is the relative absence of technological progression throughout Neanderthal existence. This is a stark contrast to the rapid pace at which we have developed our own technology, and the rapid rate at which our language has evolved. This leads to the question: why have we made so much more technological progress than they did, despite their skill at flaking stone and making tools, while Neanderthal ‘art’ remained restricted to a few highly contested scratches and blobs of pigment\n",

Today, the community is one of the largest in the world, with more than 100,000 members living in more than 1,000 communes across Canada and five states in the U.S. For his film The Hutterite (1964), the Canadian director Colin Low was given rare access to a Huttite colony in Alberta, where he detailed the community’s history, beliefs and social structure with diligence and respect.

For instance, innovations to help them work the land are embraced, and marriage is no longer arranged. In his portrait, Low emphasises the ways in which the Huttersites both intersect with and insulate themselves from the modern world.

Her books include Specters of Slapstick and Silent Film Comediennes (2018) and Death by Laughter: Female Hysteria and Early Cinema (2024). Edited by Sam Dresser In the early 20th century, women in the United States and Canada were being terrorised into believing that their unrestrained pleasure could destroy them. At the same time, they were enticed by a ballooning entertainment industry to laugh louder, more convulsively, and with greater corporeal abandon than ever before. Variety shows, pleasure parks, phonograph parlours, roller rinks, dance halls, wax museums and electricity displays numbered among the many uproarious spaces where women could at last savour their participation in ‘mass culture and a new urban crowd’, as Vanessa Schwartz writes in Spectacular Realities (1999). Often compared to a crazy dream or collective hallucination, cinema epitomised the potentials of popular new spectacles to transform the material conditions of ordinary experience for disenfranchised and minoritised audiences. In cinema (if not in real life), women got to have the last laugh in retaliation against their male tormentors and capitalist oppressors. Politically active women were irresistible subjects of representation for the new medium of cinema. In early feminist films such as The Dairymaid’s Revenge (1899), The Nursemaids’ Strike (1907) and The Suffragette‘s Dream (1909), women break all the dishes in the kitchen, wave protest signs that say: ‘Down With The Bosses’ and weaponise freshly squeezed cow’’ milk to humiliate their sexual assaulters. It is worth emphasising that most of these movies were slapstick comedies. (Imagine trying to laugh while wearing a whalebone corset.) The explosive popularity of cinema and other such amusements around the turn of the century liberated women. They lobbied for the vote, took up space in public, walked off the job, protested for higher pay and better labour conditions, and migrated across the world to seek out new lives in melting-pot urban metropolises.

All you need to do is work a little harder. As a saying often attributed to the Roman philosopher Seneca goes: ‘Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.’ A similar proverb is dated to the 16th century reflect so that ‘Diligence is the mother of good luck; chance only favours the mind which is prepared, and chance is the father of bad luck.‘ And even the French chemist Louis Pasteur echoed the idea when he declared in 1854 that “chance only favour the mind that is prepared’. Today, many of us still believe that our fortunes can be engineered. But that is not always how the world works. Luck plays an ungovernable and unpredictable role in our lives, which we can’t fully mitigate through preparation or diligence. So why do we continue to believe we can turn our luck around? On 18 August 1913, at a casino in Monteaco, a roulette wheel was spun, and the ball fell on black. This is not unusual. The alternating red and black colours of a Roulette wheel mean that, like a coin toss, there is roughly a 50-50 chance that the ball will land on either colour. But as the ball continued to land on black, again and again and in the belief that it was going to be the same string to end, gamblers rushed to the table, placing bets on red. But they continued to lose. Improbably, the ball would settle on black a total of 26 times. The ‘Monte Carlo fallacy, also known as the ‘gambler’s fallacy’, is a common psychological phenomenon. It is the mistaken belief that there is a sense of balance in how luck plays out. It explains why gamblers playing roulette mistakenly believe that one colour is overdue after a consecutive series of the other colour, even though the odds remain 50%-50. Take the case of flipping a coin. If we flip a coin 10,000 times, close to 50 per cent of the total flips will be heads and close to 100 per cent will be tails.

I was angry at what my body was ‘doing to me’, and at first I kept trying to push it to do my will, which usually meant doing more than was reasonable. Eventually, I made a pact with myself.

There is so much to see.’ In 1998, the pioneering US feminist artist Barbara Hammer (1939-2019) spent a month at an artist residency in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Feeling ‘compelled to do absolutely nothing’ while living in a dune shack without running water or electricity, Hammer documented her solitude with a journal, a tape recorder and a 16mm film camera. For decades, these materials remained in her personal archive, until, as Hammer was nearing the end of her life in 2018, she entrusted her friend, the celebrated US filmmaker Lynne Sachs, to craft a film with the materials. For the project, Sachs recorded Hammer reading from her decades-old journals during her final months. Hammer, who is known for her provocative and often controversial artworks, here provides a widely accessible yet distinctive account of solitude, beauty and where these two experiences met during her month on the beach. Her intimate, diaristic account is accompanied by gorgeous nature shots in which she plays with filters and frame rates, seemingly with no other motive than creative exploration. And, connecting past and present through her editing, including the use of the word ‘single’ in the title of the film, and the juxtaposition of images of the Cape Cod coastline with Hammer reading aloud from her journals, as well as her own reflections on her own mortality, the film provides a delicate narrative structure. But, percolating just beneath the surface is a more expansive celebration of artistry, and a sense of the power of the individual to observe, contemplate, refract and give new contours to the world. In one sense, A Month of single Frames is a touching coda to Hammer‘s life, as the film concludes with the artist revisiting her own poignant meditations on mortality.

In 2016, the anthropologist Andrew Irving walked up to people on the streets of New York and asked them to say out loud what they were saying to themselves in their minds. ‘One person might be debating what to have for lunch or silently singing the lyrics of a pop song, while others are reminiscing about their childhood, fretting about money or fantasising about a work colleague,’ he wrote. Irving acknowledged that there was a gap between what he could record in the field and what was going on in someone’m mind. Nevertheless, there have been attempts to make the internal external. The US sociologist Norbert Wiley noted the parallels. In Inner Speech and the Dialogical Self (2016), he wrote: ‘Life is something of a silent movie, and inner speech makes it hang together. After all, in real life, there is no audio with closed captions.’ Wiley also noted that inner speech is a way of communicating with the audience. It is a kind of voiceover, and it can be used to communicate to the audience in a way similar to the way a character is talking to them. When a movie voiceover communicates something to the viewer in this way, it’t mimicking social speech, as if the movie director or writer are talking to you. In Terrence Malick's movie Badlands (1973), we hear the voiceover of a character who is trying to kill another man. In a scene from the movie Adapt\n",

Photo by Kyle Grillot/Reuters Guide by Lucia Tecuta + BIO  Save  Share  Post  Email is a cognitive behavioural therapist and clinical psychologist specialised in rational emotive behaviour therapy, ecotherapy and climate-conscious therapy. She is currently an assistant professor at the University of Bologna in Italy conducting research on the relationship between ecological and climate concerns and sustainable behaviours, and she is a member of the Climate Psychology Alliance. Climate anxiety – which refers to the experience of anxiety and related feelings (such as despair, sadness and anger) about the impacts of climate change – can manifest in various, often very challenging ways. From increasingly frequent extreme-weather events, such as floods and wildfires, to rising temperatures that yield eerily mild winters and hellishly hot summers, climate change has become nearly impossible to ignore. As a result, more people than ever are bringing distress about the climate crisis into their therapists’ offices, where therapists like me have been helping them grapple with it. If you are struggling with intense feelings related to climate change, and if your anxiety is becoming harder to manage, this Guide can help you better understand the challenge and start to make your feelings more manageable. Hopefully, it will inspire you to take action in the process, and to connect with others to share the burden of these profound and complex feelings. Structural change is the real solution for climate anxiety, but as people work together to achieve that, we can also focus on building emotional resilience. When and why climate anxiety poses a problem chronic It can be distressing to even just think about the global climate crisis and the disorienting uncertainty associated with it, and it’s not uncommon for people who are concerned about the future of the planet to feel a sense of helplessness or hopelessness. There is a difference, however, between being concerned about climate crisis, as most people across the globe seem to be, and being impaired by it. Some degree of anxiety about the problem shows that a person cares deeply and is paying attention to what is, in fact, a global emergency. The focus of concern can span from the state of your own health and well-being, to the welfare of other living beings, and can be a sign that you care deeply about the planet and the very future of human existence. Some scholars have even deemed climate anxiety a constructive\n",

      "Summary: Sections The Future of Mental Health Dispatches on the latest efforts in psychological and psychiatric treatment Membership services like Flow Club, Flown and Caveday offer online study halls complete with proctors and goal setting Frederick Reimers Freelance writer In June 2022, Susan Lieu’s dream of publishing a book was turning into a nightmare. She’d signed a contract with a major publishing house to deliver a memoir about finding her way in the world after her mother, a nail salon owner who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1979 the age of 38 or graduation into the book, but her mother had died in 2014 from a botched tummy tuck procedure. She was procrastinating, feeling isolated writing in her basement, and juggling the responsibilities of raising a toddler. “I’m an extrovert,” says Lieu, who even thanked the company in her acknowledgments. Then a friend told her about flow Club, a membership service that hosts dozens of online coworking sessions a day. Lieu quickly ramped up to spending five to ten hours a day in the virtual shared workspaces. Seven months later, she turned in the manuscript to what would become The Manicurist‘s Daughter, published this March to significant acclaim. More than a year later, though, Lieu was far behind the word count she‘d need in order to publish the book before her own 38th birthday. Flow Club helped her get back on track, she says, and she was able to finish the book by the end of the year. ”I don’t think I would have finished my memoir without Flow Club.” Why did it work for her? For one thing, says Leu, Flow Club taps into accountability, the positive social pressure we feel when our actions are answerable to others. It also taps into the power of peer-to-peer communication, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of completing a goal if a person shares it with someone else. Flown is one of the companies that offers this type of coworking service. Participants in each one-to three-hour live study hall are encouraged by a proctor to set goals and report on progress at the end, but the majority of the time it’re just a group of people working simultaneously in front of their computer cameras. I’ve found that Flow Club and other coworking platforms\n",
      "Summary: Sections This space-age sensation kicked the American road trip into high gear Steven Melendez In the late 1920s, an ambitious young Stanford grad named Wally Byam found himself in booming Los Angeles, far from the rural Oregon of his youth, where he and his family had been happy, and frequent, campers. Byam, a magazine publisher, couldn’t wait to ditch his suit and tie and take to the road. Familiar with the power of print, he took out magazine ads that sold blueprints for do-it-yourself trailers. The timing worked out well, as his own publishing business began drying up after the 1929 stock market crash, and when a neighbor asked Byam to build him a camper, the inventor went one step further, ditching backyard tinkering to open a small factory in Culver City, California, in 1931. The company soon had 75 employees working 18 hours per day to meet demand, touting sales to Hollywood stars and even the president of Mexico. “Your home is wherever your wheels come to a stop,” wrote Byam in Fifth Avenue on Wheels, a 1953 road-trip guide that emphasized the Manhattan-worthy luxury that Airstream offered, including such pacifying comforts as shock absorbers and modern stoves, which Byam cheerfully extolled throughout the volume. The result was a triumph of design and marketing, and it helped create the very idea of the modern road trip. In the early 1930s, Byam and his wife, Mary, were living in Los Angeles. He wanted to go camping on days off, but his wife proved less enthusiastic about sleeping on the dewy ground. He devised a compromise, elevating their tent on a wooden platform that sat atop the chassis from an old Ford Model T; the Byams’ own car then towed the tent-laden contraption. When the couple began pulling this trailer with their Dodge, the setup continued to draw considerable attention on the road—and Byam saw an opportunity amid all that gawking. The couple’s trailer was so popular that Byam decided to sell it for $1,000, and the company began selling it in the spring of 1932. ”It was the first time I’d ever sold a trailer for a profit,’’ Byam told a reporter at the time, “and I thought it was a great idea.”\n",
      "Summary: Sections A new course at University of Hawaii at Manoa rethinks historic preservation, having enrollees design digital twins of notable structures so that people can experience them virtually Aaron Boorstein / Staff Contributor In early August 2023, wildfires devastated the Hawaiian island of Maui. The dayslong blaze, whose exact cause and origin are still unknown, displaced thousands of residents, scorched over 2,500 acres of junior see that buildings and led to the deaths of over 100 people—the deadliest United States wildfire in more than a century. Lahaina, a historic town on Maui’s western shore, was hit especially hard. During that second week of August, four major wildfires appeared across the island, but nearly all reported deaths were Lahaina residents. In 1962, Lahaina was designated a National Historic Landmark for its historical significance and well-preserved architecture. During the mid to late 19th century, thousands of Chinese immigrants, worked in Lahaina as sugar cane farmers, and the town became a hub for the sugar industry in the Hawaiian Islands. More than 2,200 of Lahaina‘s buildings were damaged or destroyed, including its culturally and historically significant 150-year-old Wo-hing Society Hall, which was built in 1873 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first American Protestant mission to the island. In 1859, the Old Lahaina Courthouse was built to serve two purposes: a customs house for whaling and commercial ships, and a center for governmental business, court affairs and incarceration. Between 1834 and 1835, after Lahaina transformed itself into the whaling center of the Pacific and Kamehameha II allowed Christian missionaries to settle the Hawaiian islands, one such missionary, the Reverend Ephraim Spaulding, built the Baldwin Home—the oldest house standing on Mauing before the fire. After the missionaries built the home, they used it as a home for their families, who lived in each one of the three rooms. After Spalding fell ill and left Hawaii in 1836, the Rev Dwight Baldwin and his family became the residents—hence the building’m name. In 1934, the Master’S Reading Room was constructed to connect ship officers, sailors and their families with the missionaries. In the early 20th century the town’ s sugar industry was whaling, and Lahaina became the capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom. By the mid 19th\n",

While it was one small bite for man, it was a giant leap for breakfast-kind. “In the 1950s, there was a specific messaging around the idea of spending less time in your kitchen. Efficiency was the real name of the game,” says Jessica Carbone, a former member of the food history team at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History and a contributing editor to Saveur. But what allowed people to be more efficient was science and innovation. A lot of the industrialized food products of the mid-20th century come from wartime food processes being reconfigured to appeal to the mass markets. The moment it debuts is in this specific sweet spot between the wartime technologies and the birthof the U.S. food marketplace. Gregory Wakeman | Freelance writer In September 1964, Kellogg’all stores introduced the first Pop-tarts to the world. When they were first introduced for a run in Cleveland, Ohio, in the summer of 1964, they were a hit with children and adults alike, and the company was able to make them look even more irresistible and mouthwatering to younger viewers thanks to the emergence of color televisions, which were overtaking their black-and-white counterparts in the 1960z. Pop--tart were an instant smash hit upon their release. What made Pop-Cup a success was the fact that they could be eaten in various flavors squished between two thin pastry crusts. It was the convenience with which adults and children alike could open and instantly devour them. You don’t have to be in a kitchen at all to enjoy a Pop-Bart. Or that they can be eaten toasted or cold. But while Pop-Parts and their packaging might look like something an astronaut would eat in space, the content inside is more closely linked to food innovations from World War II. A marketing story. An ingredient story. And a product story. When the PopTart was first introduced in Cleveland in 1964, the cereal company was a leading player in the United States food marketplace, and a number of marketing people deserve the credit for its success. ”The idea of eating breakfast outside of the kitchen was a completely modern\n",
      "Summary: Sections Long confined to regions with volcanic activity, the method of harnessing energy from the Earth promises to become much more versatile thanks to new technologies that have been developed in the U.S., says geologist Ann Robertson-Tait, president of GeothermEx, a geothermal energy consulting division at the oilfield services company SLB. Since 1970, engineers have been developing “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS) that do just that, applying methods similar to the hydraulic fracturing—or fracking—used to suck oil and gas out of deep rocks. The advances have garnered hopes that with enough time and money, geothermal power—which currently generates less than 1 percent of the world’s electricity, and 0.4 percent of electricity in the United States—could become a mainstream energy source. Some posit that geothermal could be a valuable tool in transitioning the energy system off of fossil fuels, because it can provide a continuous backup to intermittent energy sources like solar and wind. Since last November, this carbon-free, Earth-borne power has been flowing onto a local grid in Nevada. The site, known as Project Red, pumps water thousands of feet into the ground, down where rocks are hot enough to roast a turkey. Around the clock, the structure sucks the heated water back up; it is then used to power generators. Such next-generation geothermal plants have been in the works for decades, but they’ve proved expensive and technologically difficult, and have sometimes even triggered earthquakes. Some experts hope that newer efforts like Project Red may now, finally, signal a turning point, by leveraging techniques that were developed in oil and shale gas extraction to improve reliability and cost efficiency. “It’ll be a long time before we’re going to be able to use geothermal for electricity,” says geothermex’ president and chief executive officer of the geothermal consulting division, Ann Robertson Tait, in an interview with Knowable Magazine. Glistening in the dry expanses of the Nevada desert is an unusual kind of viable issues was was was a relatively niche source of electricity, largely limited to volcanic regions like Iceland where hot springs bubble from the ground. In places where molten rock sizzles close to the surface, water will seep through porous volcanic rock, warm up and bubble upward as hot water, steam or both.

      "Summary: Sections The genealogy company has digitized and published 38,000 newspaper articles from between 1788 and 1867—before Black Americans were counted as citizens in the U.S. census Sarah Kuta The Smithsonian Daily Correspondent Thanks to the rise of commercial genealogy platforms, millions of Americans are now researching their family histories. However, for many Black Americans, the process can be challenging, if not impossible, because of insufficient documentation describing their enslaved ancestors. “Ancestry tracing often leads to dead ends, uncertainty and more questions, especially when it comes to identifying the enslaved,” as Tracy Scott Forson wrote for Smithsonian earlier this year. Now, a newly released database of historic records may help fill in some of those gaps. The collection, called “Articles of Enslavement, ” is free for anyone to access online. The newly published documents, which cover the pages of more than 400 newspapers from the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, Ancestry said in a statement. This week, an Ancestry team worked with Smithsonian magazine to digitize and publish 38,400 newspaper articles containing the names, ages, physical descriptions and locations of over 183,000 enslaved people in America. The company also worked with Bethany Bell, a historian at the University of Virginia, to offer recommendations for prioritizing mental and emotional health while reading the documents. Ancestry acknowledges that the documents may be distressing or traumatic to read. In a video, Sewell-Smith urges users to take an “open and critical approach” to their research. Bell shared tips for parsing the newspaper articles, including “hidden meanings and unstated implications” and what to look out for while reading. The new Ancestry collection could help Black families across the country who are interested in tracing their roots. Black Americans are not as well documented as their white counterparts, according to Forson’s article in The Smithsonian Daily News. As such, to find information from before 1870, Black families need documents other than census records—which the new Ancestry collection might be able to help with. Some of the newspaper documents describe the buying and selling of enslaved people. Others are more like classified ads, with enslavers offering rewards for the return of runaways. For example, in 1788, an enslaver named David Hawkins published a short piece in the Poughkeepsie Journal offering a\n",

These are the types of places where communities come together to celebrate the reopening of a more than 200-year-old lighthouse, and to welcome a Major League Baseball event to a historic ballpark. The sort of spots where local citizens have come up with innovative ways to reimagine their town for a new generation, such as the opening of a live music hall inside a former church. From full-moon hikes among lunar-like landscapes to Friday night bluegrass jams, they’re the locales that truly embrace all that this country has to offer … and then some. Much like last year, this year’s towns vary in size, but their populations are all fewer than 25,000 residents, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimates. They also boast vast cultural experiences, superb nature, and a plethora of activities and events, not to mention an anniversary or opening that makes 2024 an especially great year to visit. Glassboro, New Jersey, for example, is finally welcoming the public to its long-awaited Jean & Ric Edelman Fossil Park and Museum of Rowan University, while the small town of Beaufort, South Carolina, is commemorating 30 years since its starring role in the beloved, Academy Award-winning film, Forrest Gump. From the 50th anniversary of Mammoth Site, the largest mammoth research facility on the planet, in Hot Springs, South Dakota, to a major mountain expansion in Aspen, Colorado, here are 15 towns that are encouraging us to get out there and explore. This August, one of the oldest lighthouses in the country will be revealing its restoration to the public. The unveiling of the Old Scituate Light, a historic beacon built of split granite blocks that overlooks Scittuate Harbor, and was activated in 1811, takes place on August 7, National Lighthouse Day. An elaborate set of ten bells, which are played on special occasions, are located at the top of its 123 stairs. Although plans for the day are still unfolding, many local restaurants will be including lighthouse-inspired dishes and drinks—such as fresh seafood at spots like Salt\n",
      "Summary: Sections Untold Stories of American History Explore the lives of little-known changemakers who left their mark on the country History | June 11, 2024 7:15 a.m. It was June 12, 1878, and a huge crowd, by some accounts measuring in the thousands, had gathered at a baseball field in Hartford, Connecticut. The spectators had each paid 15 cents for a chance to witness history. Such a sight was uncommon but not unheard of at the time. The flying machine—if one could really call it that—was an unsightly jumble of mechanical parts. The design consisted of a 500-foot-wide base topped by multiple nested structures that rose up over the course of several hours, eventually reaching a height of about 1,000 feet. From this contraption hung a framework of steel and brass rods that the Philadelphia Times likened to “the skeleton of a boat.” The aeronaut would sit on this framework as though it were a bicycle, controlling the craft with foot pedals and a hand crank that turned a four-bladed propeller. Because the balance of weight and equipment was so delicate, Ritchel was too heavy to fly the craft. Instead, he employed pilot Mark W. Quinlan, who tipped the scale at just 96 pounds. When preparations for the craft were complete, the crowd watched in eager anticipation as Quinlan boarded the so-called pilot’s seat. The airship rose 50 feet, then 100 feet, and then 200 feet. The device did not inspire confidence. “When I was making it, people laughed at me a lot,” Quinlan told the Hartford Courant in 1878. ” They laughed at Noah when he built the ark.“They laughed at Monty Python when he made the pyramids, and they laughed at the Wright brothers when they built the airplane,“ Quinlan added. The record, however, is crystal clear on one count: Quinlan was very, very brave. The real question: Once the the craft was in the air, could it be controlled?

      "Summary: Sections History | July/August 2024 Thomas Jefferson imagined the waterway as the heart of his “empire of liberty” as he dispatched surveyors to measure a land already occupied by Native Americans Louisiana Purchase State Park in Holly Grove, Arkansas, lies on the spot where the land surveys of the new territories originated. On October 27, 1815, Prospect Robbins arrived by boat at the point in the alluvial swamps where the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers meet. He planted a post in the ground to mark his arrival, and then, along with his team, he began to trek into the muck. On the same day, a second man, Joseph Brown, embarked with a separate team at another confluence: the mouth of the St. Francis River. They would cross the landscape at a right angle, with Robbins headed north, Brown headed west. Both surveyors were veterans—Brown a captain, Robbins a lieutenant—of an army that a few months earlier had been fending off a British invasion. Now, they were official emissaries of the United States government: here not just to scout the landscape but also to lay upon it a perfect rectilinear grid. After the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War in 1783, Britain ceded more territory that doubled the size of the U.S. Along with the original 13 colonies, the new country now included territory that stretched all the way to the Mississippi River, to the western edges of what would become Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and the northern part of Mississippi. Decades earlier, Thomas Jefferson had formed a vision for new territory west of the Appalachian Mountains: It would serve as the foundation for a new nation, and the land would be used to create an empire of landed farmers, or “husbandmen.” Jefferson did not want the soot-stained, over-mobbed cities that were growing like “sores” on the body of Europe. Nor was untamed nature a suitable fit for the new nation. He hoped the Mississippi watershed would be converted to a garden—or a collection of gardens, spreading across the landscape like a quilt. The only shared resource he spoke of was the river itself, the highway into his promised land. In the Land Ordinance of 1785, Jefferson came up with a plan for parceling out the new territory: Lay out a perfect grid of townships, each covering 36 square miles,\n",
      "Summary: Sections The Apollo 8 lunar module pilot also served in the U.S. Air Force and worked extensively on nuclear energy projects Christian Thorsberg Anders, the only one of the Apollo 8 crew who captured the iconic “Earthrise” photograph in December 1968, has died at the age of 90. The small, vintage plane he was piloting alone—a Beechcraft T-34 Mentor—crashed into the water near Roche Harbor, Washington, on June 7, local officials confirmed. “The family is devastated,” his son, retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Greg Anders, tells the Associated Press’ Gene Johnson and Audrey McAvoy. Anders, who was a member of NASA’s third group of astronauts, had been in the United States Air Force for more than 40 years and had served as a nuclear reactor specialist for the Department of Energy, according to the National Air and Space Museum. In the skies over California and Iceland, he served as an all-weather fighter pilot, and he later managed nuclear reactor shielding and radiation effects programs at New Mexico‘s Air Force Weapons Laboratory. In a 2015 interview with Forbes’ Jim Clash, Anders said: “I’m very proud to be an astronaut.” “He traveled to the threshold of the moon and helped all of us see something else: ourselves,“ NASA Administrator Bill Nelson wrote on X.com in a tribute to Anders, which was posted on the website of the National Space Council on June 8, 2018, the New York Times Daily Correspondent William A.

      "Summary: Sections Cool Finds The “excellently preserved” chess knight, six-sided die and several other pieces are all about 1,000 years old Sonja Anderson New York City, New York Daily Correspondent Researchers have discovered a small trove of medieval game pieces hidden in a German castle. The cache was uncovered during excavations of a forgotten castle in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg, according to an announcement from the regional council of Stuttgart, the state’s capital. Protected from the elements, the game pieces were found in “exceptional” condition. “They were lying under the debris of a wall, where they were lost or hidden in the Middle Ages,” says Michael Kienzle, an archaeologist at Germany‘s University of Tübingen, in a statement from the university. Researchers carefully removed the artifacts and analyzed them in the lab. The collection includes a chess knight—which may have been used by real knights—alongside a six- sided die and four pieces shaped like flowers. The pieces date to between the 11th and 12th centuries. Each game piece is made of carved antlers, and residues found in the labs indicate that some of them may have once been painted red. The newly discovered game pieces are currently undergoing chemical analysis. In the meantime, researchers have created 3D models of the chess piece, the die and one of the flower-shaped tokens. As researchers continue their investigation, they hope to glean new insights into medieval nobles’ gaming habits and the history of chess in Europe. Chess evolved from a game called Chaturanga, which was first recorded in ancient India around the sixth century. This early version of the game “pitted four players, each assuming the role of an imperial military arm, against each other, in an attempt to capture the territory of the other player, who would then have to defend it against the invading army,’” as Smithsonian magazine’S Meilan Solly wrote in 2020, adding that some the rules may sound familiar: “Infantry, for instance, marched forward and captured diagonally like pawns, while cavalry traveled in L-shapes like knights.” Eventually, chess spread into Europe by way of the Muslim world. By the end of the 12th century, the games were played in Europe\n",
      "Summary: Sections A stagnant high-pressure system over the region is trapping heat, exacerbating high temperatures and setting records Will Sullivan The Daily Correspondent A heat wave in the western United States that started last week has been made even hotter by a “heat dome” sitting over the southern U.S., according to New Scientist’s Michael Le Page. The heat dome is thought to be contributing to these record-breaking temperatures. Temperatures reached 111 degrees Fahrenheit in Las Vegas, Nevada; 113 degrees in Phoenix, Arizona; and 122 degrees in California‘s Death Valley on Thursday, all daily records, per CNN’“The heat dome, which is the result of a high pressure system in the upper parts of the atmosphere that is stuck in a place for days or weeks, is causing the extreme heat to break records across the southwestern U. S. for this time of year. This phenomenon occurs when a large area of high pressure sits in the same place for a long period of time. Pressure systems usually move from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere, ushered along by the jet stream. The pressure system needs to get moving again to release the heat. “If [the jet stream] was blowing through Arizona, we’d be maybe even rainy,” Joellen Russell, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona, tells NPR. The jet stream is responsible for moving the air from the north to the south in the United States, according to the National Weather Service, per New Scientist. It also moves the air south to north in the Southern Hemisphere, which helps to keep the temperature in the region cool. But in the Southwest, the pressure system can sometimes bend into a loop—shaped sort of like the Greek letter omega (Ω)—leading pressure systems to get trapped. ”The heat domes are kind of like a lid on a pot. As the ground warms, it dries up, making it easier to heat, too.” Hot air underneath the heat dome gets heated even more—the dome pushes the heat air down and compresses it, which increases its temperature. While warmer temperatures are becoming more common due to human-caused climate change. One recent study, however, found that climate change “is actually favoring the jettisoning of heat from the atmosphere, which creates these stagnant hot-pressure systems and the extremely heat and drought associated with them, ” Michael Mann,\n",
      "Summary: Sections The 17th-century artworks were recovered from Germany and placed at the Paris museum in the 1950s Ella Feldman | The Washington Post’s Daily Correspondent During World War II, the Nazis stole two seventeen-century paintings from a Jewish family in France. After spending decades at the Louvre, they were recently returned to the owners’ heirs—who decided to donate them back to the museum. They are now on view at the museum as part of a new exhibition on Nazi-looted art. Floris van Schooten and Peter Binoit, the owners of Still-Life With Ham and Food, Fruit and Glass on a Table, respectively, were stolen from a Parisian mansion owned by Mathilde Javal, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). During the war, some members of the Javal family went into hiding or fought in the resistance. Five were deported from France and murdered at Auschwitz. The Nazis stole some 650,000 artworks between 1933 to 1945, “many from Jewish families who were arrested and then killed in concentration camps during the Holocaust,” as the Associated Press’ Bobby Caina Calvan wrote last year. French museums still house many of the pieces without confirmed owners. In recent years, a number of restitution efforts carried out by the descendants of Jewish families have been successful. About ten years ago, a group of genealogy professionals partnered with France‘s culture ministry to investigate the rightful owners of six paintings in the National Museum Recuperation program—including Still-LIFE With Ham. The research was conducted free of charge. However, a lack of sufficient information about ownership, as well as errors in the spelling of names and addresses, prevented the return of the paintings, per AFP. The two works were ultimately returned to Marion, one of the heirs. It is a “duty of memory towards my family, looted from and persecuted, whose history speaks to current generations, ” Marion, who did not want to give her full name, told AFP. In 2014, the heirs of a well-known Jewish-Austrian performer won their own hard-fought restitution battle. Other heirs are still fighting in court for restitution, while the ownership of thousands of looted artworks remain unknown. In 1944, Nazis stole the two paintings from the home of a Jewish-French family in Paris, per a statement from the Museum of Fine Arts, Louvre\n",
      "Summary: Sections A new study suggests people in the Eurasian steppe bred horses around 2200 B.C.E., challenging earlier ideas about the beginnings of horse husbandry Christian Thorsberg / The Daily Correspondent The domestication of horses is arguably among the most important achievements by early humans, allowing for massive advancements in travel, hunting and combat. Now, in a wide genomic study, researchers suggest they have pinpointed when and where this revolution occurred, calling into question earlier theories about the history of horse manry. In a study published last week in the journal Nature, archaeologists used DNA analysis to trace horse domestication to roughly 2200 b.c.E.—about 1,000 years later than previously thought. The team suggests the Bronze Age Sintashta culture achieved this feat and quickly used the animals to move and expand throughout Eurasia. But the culture died out without sharing their practice, and the horses again roamed free throughout Central Asia. But then, roughly 4,200 years ago, humans domesticated horses once more, according to the new research. At that time, one particular horse lineage became dominant, they found. It emerged from the Pontic-Caspian stepp—a region of plains that stretches through modern-day bir-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia—and spread across Eurasia in a matter of centuries. “We saw this genetic type spreading almost everywhere in Eurasia—clearly this horse type that was local became global very fast,” Ludovic Orlando, a molecular archaeologist at the Center for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France and a co-author of the study, tells the Associated Press’ Christina Larson. Orlando and the team analyzed DNA from 475 ancient Eurasian horses—some of which lived as far back as 50,000 Years ago—and 77 modern, domestic horses representing 40 different breeds and the endangered Przewalski’s horse. They analyzed human skeletons, five of which showed wear marks on specific bones that indicated these individuals likely rode horses. Comparing these findings with archaeological evidence and carbon dating, they created a revised timeline of horse and human history that may tell a more complete equine story. The ancient horse DNA also revealed evidence of human control over the animals’ reproduction. Archaeologists noted mating between closely related horses and a reduced length of time between generations, from about seven years to four years. This is “potentially a\n",
      "Summary: Sections New Research A genetic analysis of opulent burial mounds in Germany sheds new light on how power passed through family lines                 Sonja Anderson | READ MORE | Daily Correspondent In the Iron Age, many Celtic elites were buried in luxurious graves filled with ceremonial wagons, jewelry, furniture and dining wares. Such burials have made historians wonder: How did these individuals garner such wealth? According to a new study, they got it from their mothers. Researchers recently conducted genetic testing on 31 skeletons found in seven opulence burial sites in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, all dating to between 616 and 200 B.C.E. Their analysis found that two men occupying two of the richest graves, located about six miles apart, were related. According to the study, which was published this month in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, the ancient men may have been an uncle and nephew—more specifically, a man and his sister’s son. In other words, early Celtics didn’t just inherit power from their families; power appears to have been passed down specifically through female lines. “This result shows that political power in this society was most likely inherited through biological succession, comparable to a dynasty,” says study co-author Joscha Gretzinger, a researcher with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in a statement. Researchers think the younger deceased man garnered the wealth apparent in his burial through his mother’m side of the family, while the older man, who was buried in the middle of the burial mound, may have inherited his wealth from his father, who is believed to have passed it on to his son, who in turn passed it down to his daughter, who, in turn, passed it to her son. As such, “matrilinear avunculate organization”—inheritance via a maternal uncle—is more common in populations that conduct frequent extramarital affairs, which lowers confidence in a child’�s true paternity, per the researchers. In the Celtic context, however, the practice of matrilineal dynastic succession may be more common than previously thought. The Celts were a group of Central European tribes with similar cultural and religious traditions. First mentioned by ancient Greek writers around the fifth century B.C., the tribes thrived during the Iron Age. The rich burial\n",

      "Summary: new video loaded: Palestinians in the West Bank Are Living in the Shadow of the War in Gaza transcript In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians live in the shadow of the ongoing war in Gaza. For them, this has meant increased raids and arrests, tightening security restrictions, settler violence and economic turmoil. We spent time with two Palestinians whose lives and livelihoods are being reshaped by the war and who worry that some of these changes may be long lasting. 29-year-old taxi driver and tour guide Laith Al-Muti now waits all day here at one of the Israeli-controlled checkpoints into Bethlehem. Sites he used to frequent with tourists, like the Church of the Nativity, now sit empty. Thirteen miles away in the Tel Rumeida area of Hebron, Wijdan Ziadeh’s life is also at a standstill. Control over security in Hebron is divided into two zones. H1 is managed by the Palestinian Authority and H2, which includes Tel-Rumeida, is run by the Israeli military. The Israeli military told The Times that security measures have increased in the area as part of a response to terrorist operatives, including Hamas, and that their forces are there to help ensure the safety of all residents. The site of an Israeli settlement, Palestinian residents in Tel-Raumeida say their movement, limited before the war, has felt even more restricted since Oct. 7. The Israelis say they are protecting the settlers and that they are doing everything they can to protect the residents of the area. But Ziyadh says her life has become even more difficult since the war began. The area is home to thousands of Israeli settlers. The settlers have been accused of attacking Palestinian civilians, including women and children, and have been prosecuted by the U.N., who have recorded nearly 950 attacks as of June 2024. But ZiadeH lives in fear of scenes of settler aggression like this one captured by a nearby Palestinian resident. Throughout the West bank, incidents of settor violence against Palestinians jumped in the aftermath of Oct. 5 and Oct. 6, and they have continued to rise since Oct 7, according to a recent Times investigation. Palestinians in this area say they fear for their safety. The Israel Defense Forces said they are monitoring the situation. But these days, barely any visitors come through. The Tel-Reumeida neighborhood is divided between two zones, H1 and H-2. H2 is\n",

      "Summary: Pakistan’s economy failed to meet most of its targets set in the previous budget due to challenging conditions, but the agriculture sector achieved unprecedented growth, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced on Tuesday while unveiling the Pakistan Economic Survey (PES) 2023-24. The report said fiscal discipline was maintained, with a fiscal deficit of 3.7pc of GDP and a primary surplus of 1.2pc last year. Total revenues, meanwhile, grew by 41pc, driven by non-tax revenues and improved tax collection. However, the PES noted a decline in the investment-to-GDP ratio, sluggish large-scale manufacturing, and high public debt. The strong 6.5pc growth in the private sector, and the agricultural sector, however, was a “saviour” and a significant upside for future growth. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), meanwhile, kept a tight monetary policy, which helped to ease inflation to 26pc from 28.21 per cent in the preceding year. The finance minister credited the provinces for delivering on their surpluses, which had enabled the government to meet its commitment to the IMF. He also highlighted the significant reduction in the current account deficit, from an estimated $6bn to around $200m. The PES said the economy would grow by 2.38 per cent, recovering from a contraction of 0.5 per cent last fiscal year.    “There is no plan B and if there was a plan B, the IMF wouldn’t be called a ‘lender of the last resort’,” he said. “It is important to see the level of inflation in 2022-23. [In this] year, the Pakistani rupee suffered nearly 29pc depreciation and the foreign reserves went to just two weeks of import cover.” He praised successive administrations for the relative economic stability seen over the past few months. He praised the prime minister’“courageous step” in signing a nine-month Stand-by Agreement with the IMF, saying it had brought the country to a better place. He said it was a structural way will will be able to bring the country back to the path of growth, and that the country would have to work on the structural way to ensure the system will be back on track. Aurang, who has been in his role for three to four months, said he had always believed that Pakistan\n",
      "Summary: Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Tuesday said his country wanted to “find a solution to the issue of years-old cross-border terrorism” with Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a record-equalling third term at a grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president’s palace in New Delhi, attended by leaders of seven regional countries, underlining the government’�s “neighbourhood first” policy.    On Monday, leaders of the two countries engaged in diplomacy via X. In a video message, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as well as his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz congratulated Modi, in what was Pakistan‘s first response to the election results from across the border. But relations and problems with China and Pakistan were different. “With Pakistan, we would want to find a solution,” he told reporters, after assuming charge for a second straight term. India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border — much of it poorly demarcated — over which the nuclear-armed nations also fought a war in 1962. They have engaged in a military standoff since July last year, when at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed in the worst clashes in five decades. On ties with Pakistan, “We are not going to sit on the sidelines and wait for the other side to come to the table. That cannot be the policy of a good neighbour, we are going to work on the basis of our own interests and the interests of the people of India.”   “There is a lot of tension between India and Pakistan and we are trying to find ways to resolve it,“ he said. On the other hand, he said India will focus on finding solutions to the border issues with China that have long strained ties between the neighbouring countries. The two countries have been at loggerheads for decades over the disputed Kashmir region. On Pakistan, he added, India will continue to take a strong stance on security, especially in the context of New Delhi’ve allegations of cross-borders terrorism. The exchange was initiated by PM Shechbaz, who extended a succinct congratulatory message on X, saying: “Felicitations to @narendramodi on taking oath as the Prime Minister of India, congratulations to you.�\n",
      "Summary: The World Bank has approved $1 billion in additional financing for the Dasu Hydropower Project (DHP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Kohistan district, it emerged on Tuesday. Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. The comments section will be updated as soon as it is available again. “The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) is pleased to announce that it has approved a second round of additional financing to support the construction and operation of Dasu Hydroelectric Power Project,” the global bank said in a press release issued late last night. DHP-I has a capacity of 2,160MW and will generate 12,225 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year of low-cost renewable energy. The second stage of the project will add 4,320–5,400 megawatts (MW). “This financing will further support the expansion of hydropower electricity supply, improve access to socio-economic services for local communities, and build the Water and Power Development Authority‘s (Wapda) capacity to prepare future hydropowered projects, according to the World Bank, which is responsible for the financing of the DHP and other large-scale, low-carbon, and low-emission energy projects in the country, including DHP I, DHP II, and DHP III,’ the statement said. ”The additional financing will be used for the construction of the second phase of DHP,“ it added. According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Dasu is a “major project” in the province. ‘Through this project adult literacy has increased by an estimated 30pc since 2012, boys’ schooling increased by 16pc while girls’ nursing has improved by 70pc during this period, and the number of school-age children attending school has also increased by 30pc, while the school-to-age ratio has also improved by 50pc, the statement highlighted. Meanwhile, Rikard Liden, the task team leader for the project, stressed that DDP-I was an “essential project to reverse its dependence on fossil fuels and reach 60 per cent renewable energy by 2031”. ’’“DHP-II will add 9,260–11,400GWh per year from the same dam”, Liden stated\n",
      "Summary: LAHORE: The Lahore High Court directed the immigration and passport department to complete within three months its consultative process and amend the rules allowing women to retain the name of their father on the computerised national identity card (CNIC) and the passport, irrespective of their marital status. Justice Asim Hafeez passed the order on a petition filed by Mehr Bano Langrial, who sought a declaration that a married woman has the right to retain her father’s name on her identity documents, including, but not limited to CNIC and passport. Additional Attorney General Mirza Nasar Ahmad told the court that the federal government had no objection to the declaration sought by the petitioner. He said the column for the particulars in the passport needed revision and printing, besides sharing of newly-formatted passports with border control authorities of various foreign countries, is imperative, adding that this exercise will consume reasonable time. “It is pertinent to observe that the government shall ensure data synchronisation in the records of Nadra (National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) and immigration/passport department,” the judge said in the order issued last week. Immigration and Passport Additional Director Attaur Rehman said the consultative processes are ongoing and in order to offer such an option to the petitioner/woman, to the extent of her passport, requisite changes are required in the policy/rules. In his order, Justice Hafeez observed that the decision of the government on the declaration of the right of the married women and their children to retain their name in the “fathers name” column on the CNIC or passport is a positive step, as it would give the women the option of retaining their father's name on their identity document, including CNIC, passport and CNIC. It is to mention that as per the Nadra policy, a married man is free to decide if she wants to retain or not to retain his name on the passport or CNIC while his wife has the option to do the same. However, the office of the Directorate General of Immigration and Portport requires all married women to have their CNICs updated with their husband‘s name in an “unmarried” or “non-marital” section in the relevant column, and their passports to be updated with the husband's name in a “married/unmarried/married/non-married/divorced” and “\n",
      "Summary: LONDON: The United Kingdom and Schengen countries raised millions of pounds and euros in fees from rejected visa applications from Pakistan, new research published this month shows. The analysis released by Lago Collective, a community of researchers, policymakers and designers, shows that Pakistanis spent £5.3 million on rejected UK visa applications, with close to 40 per cent applications rejected from Pakistan in 2023. The data was published in collaboration with the EUobserver, which reported that EU governments raked in €130m per year in rejected visa application fees, which were dubbed as ‘reverse remittances’. In a statement, Lago said, “These costs are just the tip of the iceberg: in most cases, applicants pay more than the basic application fee, with private agencies involved in processing visa applications and brokers providing additional services along the way. The costs of not being able to travel for business and leisure also results into significant losses for all those involved. This is surprising given the multiple ties between Pakistan, Europe and the UK. “Yet the challenges faced by Pakistani nationals to reach Europe through legal means became tragically clear a year ago when hundreds died in the Greece boat capsize. People have no choice but to resort to dangerous journeys,” Foresti added.    The analysis compiled by Marta For­e­sti and Otho Mantegazza at Lago Coll­ective showed that the total sum is likely to increase in 2024 since the visa application fee to travel to the EU will increase from 80 to 90 for adults on June 11. It also said the UK raised £44m in rejected fees, who are non-refundable regardless of the outcome. In the same year, around 50pc ofSchengen visas from Pakistan were also rejected, with €3.344m spent on applications. African and Asian countries bear 90pc of the costs for rejected Schengn visas. Although Pakistanis have the lowest rejection rate among these countries, the amount recovered from them is higher due to a higher number of applicants. For UK visa, countries with high rejection rates include Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Algeria — bearing high costs as a result (£5.4m, £4.3m and 3.6m, respectively). Visa application fees are increasing to 90 and £120 for adults in 2024. This will result in significant increases in rejected visas in 2024, further exacerbated by the emphasis on tightening migration\n",

      "Summary: SAHIWAL: The district police have registered cases against 25 nominated and 700 unidentified workers and local leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf  (PTI), including party’s parliamentarians, ticket-holders and office-bearers of Okara, Pakpattan and Sahiwal chapters. These workers have been accused of organising and participating in a ‘workers convention’ at Anjum Farms on Sunday afternoon, without getting permission for the event. The convention was reportedly hosted by Chaudhry Asif Ali, a PTI ticket-holder from NA-142, at his farmhouse. The Ghala Mandi police have booked the suspects under various sections, including section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order, section 6  of the Punjab Sound Systems Regulation Act 2015, and sections 341, 186, 148, and 149 of the PPC, on a complaint by Sub-Inspector Zafer Iqbal, posted at the Bypass Police Check Post. The FIR alleges that some 700-750 participants in the convention were chanting slogans against the government and state institutions. So far no arrest has been made. Sources say the police and administration had exerted pressure on the farmhouse owner and organisers to prevent him from holding the convention. PTI MNA Rai Hasan Nawaz told Dawn that a day before the convention, the houses of the PTI parliamentarians and district office-bears were raided by police in Pakpattian, Sahiwall, and Okara. He says the cases were a result of the successful PTI convention. The sources say that the police also tried to prevent the workers from entering the city and attending the convention by issuing notices to them. However, the workers refused to comply with the notices and went ahead with the convention anyway, they say. The source says the police had also issued notices to PTI workers in Okara and other parts of the district. The suspects have been booked under various Sections of the IPC, including sedition, rioting, and criminal intimidation. Those named in the FIRs include MNAs Khan Muhammad Khan, MPA retired Maj Sarwar, MNA retired Maj Arifwala, Chaudhsry Muhammad Usman, PTI MPAs Mian Sajad Nasir, Faisal Jalal Dhakko, Muhammad Yar  Damra, Choudhry Saleem Sadiq, Rana Amir Shahzad, Ali\n",
      "Summary: KARACHI: The government may provide some incentives to encourage local assembly of solar panels in the budget 2024-25. Pakistan Solar Association (PSL) Senior Vice-President Mohammad Zakir Ali, who was part of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent delegation to China, said, “I do not think the government will impose any new taxes and duties on solar panels, which already have zero per cent general sales tax. Only inverters carry 18pc GST.” He said the government has been trying to lure Chinese manufacturers of different products to relocate their units in Pakistan after reports of some restrictions or curbs imposed on China by various countries. He added that when Chinese companies export to Pakistan or other countries, they get a rebate, which is the same as what they want from Pakistan after investing in the solar sector. He said Chinese investors, in interactions during the visit, had said that Pakistan needed to impose an import duty on the arrival of completely built-up (CBU) solar panels so that the local panel manufacturers could work in a healthy environment. Some solar panel dealers said that the government is unlikely to touch the net-metering issue, which had already forced the government to clarify the situation after multiple media reports regarding the imposition of a fixed tax on citizens who produce energy through solar systems, a cut in the power purchase rate for domestic net-etering consumers, and the replacement of net metering with a gross-metered mechanism. Federal Minister for Energy Awais Khan Leghari said in the third week of May that the federal government had no plans to change the solar net-meter policy. The policy was introduced in 2017, and few people applied for net-at-home connections due to the high prices of solar solar panels. Mr Zakir, however, said that there was a possibility of the government changing the policy in the next budget, as the government had already taken some steps to promote solarisation in the country. Mr Zakir said that “the government is likely to announce some incentives for solar manufacturers in the upcoming budget,” which may include the introduction of a tax on the import of CBU solar panels and a rebate on the purchase of inverters and solar panels by the local manufacturers. Pakistan solar industry may get some incentives in budget, dealers say He said this would encourage solar manufacturers to relocate to Pakistan and invest in the local market.

      "Summary: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a group photo with the chief ministers of all four provinces, prior to the meeting of National Economic Council, on Monday.—APP PHOTOS • Okays provinces’ cumulative uplift plans worth Rs2tr• GDP growth target set at 3.6pc• External debt payments to put pressure on forex reserves ISLAMABAD: In a return to previous practice by some of the provinces, including Sindh and Balochistan, to claim the federal government’s funding to some projects, while approving an indicative national development plan worth Rs3.095 trillion and agreed to continue funding the ongoing high-priority provincial projects with over 80pc completion status with a reciprocal view to discourage such projects reaching the federal budget in future. The expansionary public investment stance is likely to come under tight scrutiny of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the authorities continue negotiations for a $6-8bn bailout for over three years. Presided over by Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, the four-hour-long NEC meeting approved more than 47pc increase in the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) to Rs1.792 trillion for the next fiscal year to increase the economic growth rate to 3.4 per cent from the current 2.4pc. Provincial de­mands were also entertained, resulting in higher PSDP allocation. The federal PSDP is even 15-23pc higher than the revised PSDP approved by the National Economic Coordination Committee (NEC) in the current fiscal year. The NEC approved their cumulative annual development plans totalling Rs2.696tr.                                    The federal development programme actually goes up by 58pc or Rs1,000bn to Rs2,696tr in the next year. Another Rs197bn investment would be made by state-owned entities in development activities, taking the total size to Rs4.5tr if another Rs100bn public-private partnership (PPP) projects are included in it. This came after the Sindh chief minister pointed out that his province suffered significantly during four years of the PTI-led government when no funding was provided to their projects. Therefore, he added, Sindh deserved to be compensated for injustices of those four ‘missed years’. He also contested the mandate of the caretaker government during which period the NEC had decided to exclude provincial projects and demanded that it be considered to be ignored ab\n",

      "Summary: • Fourteen votes in favour of resolution as Russia abstains• Washington mulls talks with Hamas for release of its citizens UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a US-drafted resolution supporting a ceasefire plan in Gaza, as Washington leads an intense diplomatic campaign to push Hamas to accept the proposal. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier held talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday. His visit comes after US President Joe Biden on May 31 outlined a three-phase ceasefire proposal from Israel that envisions a permanent end to hostilities, the release of Israeli and Palestinian prisoners, and the reconstruction of Gaza. The United States, a staunch ally of Israel, has been widely criticised for having blocked several previous UN draft resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. But Biden late last month launched a new US effort to secure a truce and hostage release. “Today, we voted for peace,” US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after the UN session. The resolution adopted by the 15-member UN Security Council, which includes China, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, the United States and the United Arab Emirates, calls on all parties to “immediately and fully implement” the ceasefire and release of the hostages, and for “all parties to fully implement its terms without delay and without condition.” The resolution says Israel has accepted the truce plan, and “calls upon Hamas to also accept it”. It also calls on “international mediators to enter into indirect negotiations regarding the implementation of these principles”, and urges “both sides to fully respect the principles of the ceasefire” and for the “full implementation” of the truce. Hamas in a statement, referring to its demands that include a permanent ceasefire in Gaz and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory said it “welcomes the Security Council resolution … (and) would like to reaffirm its readiness to cooperate with the United Nations and international mediators” to implement the ceasefire. American prisoners US officials have considered negotiating a unilateral deal with Hamas to release five American prisoners held in Gaza if ceasefire talks involving Israel fail, NBC News reported on Monday, citing unidentified US officials. The officials said Hamas would have an incentive to reach such a deal with Washington because it would strain US-Israel relations further and add pressure on the\n",
      "Summary: ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly proceedings on Monday turned chaotic as the government rammed through four bills in a controversial manner amidst vociferous protests from the opposition, which accused the ruling coalition of bypassing democratic norms and stifling debate. The tumultuous sitting saw Energy Minister Awais Leghari facing the wrath of both treasury and opposition members over the ongoing power outages and loadshedding issues, with the minister conceding that power companies and its officials had been inefficient in addressing the problem. At the outset of the sitting, the opposition members belonging to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) staged a token walkout against the Punjab police for allegedly preventing opposition leader in NA Omar Ayub Khan and some MNAs from entering premises of an anti-terrorist court (ATC) in Sargodha, which resulted in the cancellation of Mr Khan’s bail. The opposition members gathered in front of the dais of the speaker and raised full-throated slogans and tore apart the copies of the bills and agenda, as Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah allowed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to put the motions for the passage of four bills which had been approved by incomplete and ad hoc standing committees formed by the speaker. All these bills had already been promulgated by the caretaker government through ordinances. The bills passed by the assembly were the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2023, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (Avolition) Bill and the Pakistan Railways (Amendments) Act, 2024, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority Bill, 2024 and the Natio­nal Highway Authority (Aviation) Bill.  󾌂 󂌂 The bills were approved by the Standing Committee on Law and Parliamentary Affairs, which was formed by former speaker Asad Qaiser. The house passed the bills after suspending the rules, which allowed the members two-day time to suggest amendments to the bills. Chief whip of the SIC Aamir Dogar later protested over what he called bulldozing the legislation and called the present government as well as the assembly as “fake”. The lawmakers from across the country took the minister to task when he sought the support of the provincial governments and the elected representatives in detecting the power theft. The minister, however, asked the chair to dedicate a full-day sitting for a debate on the issue, stating that he would come to\n",

      "Summary: ISLAMABAD: Former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qa­­i­­ser on Monday alleged that as many as 91 projects of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were excluded from the federal development budget, claiming that such policies were becoming reason of terrorism resurgence. Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, the PTI leader said that the excluded projects were related to health, education, energy and other important sectors. “We were told that additional 3pc of the NFC award will be given to KP because of the merger of erstwhile Fata but even that promise could not be fulfilled. Every year we have to get Rs100 billion but the amount is not being released,” he said. Shahram Tarakai said it was unfortunate that terrorism was increasing because of such policies of the federal government. Mr Qaiser, who was flanked by members of KP Assembly and other party leaders, said the KP was being deprived of funds just because people gave mandate to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). Former NA speaker asks if Punjab has been turned into ‘a police state’ He said that it was the responsibility of the government to ensure that the projects of the province were completed and the promise of releasing additional funds should also be fulfilled by the government.

He questioned whether Punjab was under a “police state” or under a martial law regime” where the political rights were trampled with impunity and the PTT workers were not allowed to convene a workers’ convention.    # # #  #   نفاری  فافی نیفف نو فقار  ـفو  هفس اكفر ا ا في ان او اں ام ا على اراق اہ ا ما هذا یا با نارف کا يفت اي چا\n",
      "Summary: ISLAMABAD: Under pressure from millers, the government allowed the export of 150,000 tonnes of sugar on Monday despite the high domestic retail prices hovering around Rs160 per kg. The decision came just two days before the national budget at the behest of sugar mill owners demanding to export their surplus production. These millers are part of the Pakistan Muslim League-N coalition government. However, it is interesting to note that at the time the Ministry of Industries issued the press release announcing the decision about the Sugar Advisory Board (SAB) decision, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal denied on the floor of the National Assembly that any such decision had been made. Commerce minister informs National Assembly no decision has been made Responding to a question asked by PPP’s Agha Rafiullah, the commerce minister termed such reports as a rumour. The PPP lawmaker had asked the minister to clarify the reports that the government had allowed the sugar export and expressed the fear that the country might face a situation similar to one it recently faced due to a similar decision by the caretaker government to allow the import of wheat at a time when the country had the commodity in surplus. It is worth noting that officials’ incorrect estimates of wheat production and stock led to higher wheat imports. Excessive wheat output and unneeded imports oversupplied the market, resulting in a loss for farmers. The commerce minister informed the lower house that no decision was made on sugar export or any other decision related to sugar exports. The minister stated that the SAB is the first forum to make decisions about sugar exports, which must be approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet. He said that in future, the sugar exports will depend on price stability and stock availability in the country. The federal minister said that the ex-mills sugar price will not be increased under any circumstances, and PSMA will clear all the pending payments to farmers on a priority basis. This move was reportedly made to benefit members of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PML-N), the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the PML-N members. The finance minister said the government will review the sugar prices and market stability again in a fortnight, and the decision will be taken on a case-by-case basis. The Commerce Minister said the decision to allow sugar exports was taken on the basis of market stability. He\n",
      "Summary: Wholesale and retail trade make up 18.1 per cent of Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product while contributing only 2pc in direct taxes. A majority in the country pays taxes indirectly, primarily on consumption — which disproportionately affects the poor and vulnerable households more than the affluent. As the gap between the destitute and elite increases, there is a need to increase direct taxes, which would also help expand the tax net. Presently, the corporate tax rate, dividend tax rate and some form of super tax make tax incidence on corporate activity one of the highest in the world — acting as a deterrent to any form of formal investment activity. This also creates distortion wherein informal businesses that do not pay their fair share of taxes have an unfair advantage, making tax-paying businesses uncompetitive. On the other hand, the industrial sector makes up18.4pc of the GDP and contributes 40pc to total taxes, with salaried individuals contributing 15pc to the total direct taxes while making up only 2ct of the total labour force. This suggests a total collection of Rs489 billion on an annual basis from commercial enterprises, which are primarily SMEs. It is difficult to ascertain how much revenue is generated by various SMEs at an individual level, or in aggregate. But the same can be estimated through various means. As per the State of Industry Report 2023, published by the National Electricity & Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), there were 4.1 million commercial electricity connections as of June 2023. These are mostly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), utilising a commercial electricity connection to conduct economic activity. On average, these connections consumed around 181 units of electricity monthly. Obviously, there would be a wide distribution of the various sizes of SMEs, but an average consumption of 181 units on a monthly basis makes it fair to say that such an entity would be small business. Anecdotally, this seems fairly conservative. There would certainly be wide distributions, where some high-end retailers would be consuming much more electricity, while some low-end retail outlets would consume less than 100 units. A major caveat here is that there would also be many businesses that are either using a residential connection or sharing a single connection. However, there are ways to circle in on the same. CreditBook is a digital ledger or a khata, that is used by more than 1m micro and small enterprises across the country for over the last 30 months. Through such a ledger\n",

In the run-up to the tabling of the Finance Bill, Dawn is speaking to experts to seek their input on some of the more pressing challenges facing Pakistan’s economy and how they can be addressed. In this edition, we speak to the president of the OICCI, who is also the chairman of Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd. (www.compunodecom).Designed for Dawn. Published in Dawn, June 11th, 2024 Dear visitor, the comments section is undergoing an overhaul and will return soon. Please wait for the new section to be up and running before commenting. Today, we are talking to experts on the state of the economy, and what Pakistan needs to do to make it a more attractive destination for foreign investors and corporations to invest in the country. Pakistan is facing a number of challenges. Macroeconomic stability, through prudent fiscal and monetary policies, is essential. In addition to this, Information Technology, as well as renewable energy have emerged as sectors with a resource competitive advantage. To fully realise their potential, Pakistan must focus on improving regulatory frameworks, ensuring policy consistency and enhancing infrastructure to create a more investor-friendly environment Q. How can the government provide international investors the enabling environment needed to attract foreign investment? The biggest consideration for any investor is a stable macro-economic and political environment, which in turn, breeds consistency in policy frameworks. The government should work towards maintaining consistent and predictable policies, reducing political unrest, and ensuring smooth transitions of power. Q. What positive steps have been taken to stimulate economic growth and what more can be done? Recent surveys by the oICCI have pinpointed services, manufacturing for export, agriculture and corporate farming, as potential attractions, for foreign investment. While the government has launched initiatives and offered incentives for these sectors, reaching full potential still evades us. Q: How can Pakistan attract foreign investors? A. Multinational corporations consistently implement structured programmes as part of their corporate social responsibility strategy. Strengthening these endeavours via favourable government policies will enhance the development of human capital, benefiting both investors, and the economy.

      "Summary: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday fixed for hearing an application challenging the controversial Punjab Defamation Law, which was given assent by the acting Punjab governor over the weekend. The Punjab Assembly passed the Defamation Bill, 2024 on May 20, rejecting all amendments proposed by the opposition amid protests by the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council and journalists covering parliamentary proceedings. The law, which had already drawn much flak from journalists, civil society organisations, as well as the opposition, however, soon landed in the LHC after a joint petition — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — was filed by two journalists challenging its legality.

      "Summary: The government is set to present its first budget this week since its inauguration in March, amid some “tough” conditions by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which local economists reckon would result in “heavy” taxation and inflation. The government, which received $1.1bn, the last tranche of a $3bn IMF bailout package in May, is negotiating for a “long and larger” loan programme to the tune of $7 to $8bn. The finance ministry and the IMF are locked in last-minute talks ahead of the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 as the federal government is in a fix over some tax deficit country country, a ministry official told Anadolu wishing not to be named as he was not allowed to speak on the record. The IMF’s key demands, he said, include an increase in the tax revenue target, withdrawal of subsidies, taxes on the agriculture sector, increase in levy and taxes on power, gas and oil sectors, privatisation of sick government organisations and units and improving administration. “We are negotiating with the IMF officials on these terms, and hopefully we will be able to convince them,” he maintained. The official said the government is already working on several reforms to put the economy on track. However, some of the [IMF] demands are very hard considering the current economic conditions, he added. The tax revenue was reported at $25.99bn by March 2024, as tax authorities are confident they will meet the assigned target. According to the Federal Board of Revenue, the overall revenue growth remained 31 per cent during the first 11 months of the current fiscal year compared to the same period last year. Ashfaque Hasan Khan, an Islamabad-based economist, reckoned that the IMF demands have caught Pakistan between a ’rock and a hard place”. Commenting on the report that the finance ministry is in talks with the fund for a Rs1.6tr increase in its tax target for the upcoming fiscal year despite the recent signs of economic recovery in the country, he warned that if the government fails to convince the IMF of its main focus on increasing the country‘s tax-to-GDP ratio, then it will be a ‘heavy taxation budget, as well as will delay [new] agreement with the Fund’, he explained. The “tax-to GDP ratio in the last fiscal year was nearly\n",
      "Summary: South Africa defeated Bangladesh by just four runs in another low-scoring game at the T20 World Cup on Monday, a result likely to spark fresh debate over the suitability of the pitch being used in New York. South Africa were restricted to 113-6 in their 20 overs with Heinrich Klaasen top-scoring on 46 while fast bowler Tanzim Hasan Sakib returned a career-best 3-18. However, Bangladesh could only manage 109-7 in reply as South Africa wrapped up a third win in three Group D games. Chasing just 114 to win on the controversial drop-in strip at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, Bangladesh initially struggled in the face of the Proteas’ pace battery. They were 50-4 at the 10-over mark having lost Tanzid Hasan (nine) to Kagiso Rabada while Anrich Nortje accounted for skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (14) and Shakib Al Hasan (three). Spinner Keshav Maharaj sent back Liton Das for just nine. With the pressure building both Jaker Ali and Mahmudullah were caught going for big heaves over long on. Bangladesh took seven off the penultimate over but still needed 11 off the last to be bowled by Maharaj. That became seven off four balls. Needing six off the final ball, Taskin Ahmed could only produce a scrambled single.    # # #  #   South Africa won the toss and elected to field first in the second T20 match of the tournament against the Netherlands at the same venue on Saturday. The hosts were bowled out for 109 in the 20th over after losing their first four wickets for just 23 runs in the fifth over thanks to Tanzim and Taskin. Tanzim, playing in only his eighth T20 international, started the collapse, having out-of-form opener Reeza Hendricks lbw for nought off his first ball. Star batsman Quinton de Kock was the next to go, clean-bowled by the 21-year-old for 18 with a total of 19. The pair put on 44 for the fifth wicket before Hridoy was lbw to Rabada for 37, an innings which took up 34 balls and featured two fours and two sixes. Bangladesh then lost their last two wickets in the space of three balls as the Protesas chased down the target. Earlier,\n",
      "Summary: Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Tuesday said his country wanted to “find a solution to the issue of years-old cross-border terrorism” with Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a record-equalling third term at a grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president’s palace in New Delhi, attended by leaders of seven regional countries, underlining the government’�s “neighbourhood first” policy.    On Monday, leaders of the two countries engaged in diplomacy via X. In a video message, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as well as his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz congratulated Modi, in what was Pakistan‘s first response to the election results from across the border. But relations and problems with China and Pakistan were different. “With Pakistan, we would want to find a solution,” he told reporters, after assuming charge for a second straight term. India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border — much of it poorly demarcated — over which the nuclear-armed nations also fought a war in 1962. They have engaged in a military standoff since July last year, when at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed in the worst clashes in five decades. On ties with Pakistan, “We are not going to sit on the sidelines and wait for the other side to come to the table. That cannot be the policy of a good neighbour, we are going to work on the basis of our own interests and the interests of the people of India.”   “There is a lot of tension between India and Pakistan and we are trying to find ways to resolve it,“ he said. On the other hand, he said India will focus on finding solutions to the border issues with China that have long strained ties between the neighbouring countries. The two countries have been at loggerheads for decades over the disputed Kashmir region. On Pakistan, he added, India will continue to take a strong stance on security, especially in the context of New Delhi’ve allegations of cross-borders terrorism. The exchange was initiated by PM Shechbaz, who extended a succinct congratulatory message on X, saying: “Felicitations to @narendramodi on taking oath as the Prime Minister of India, congratulations to you.�\n",
      "Summary: • Fourteen votes in favour of resolution as Russia abstains• Washington mulls talks with Hamas for release of its citizens UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a US-drafted resolution supporting a ceasefire plan in Gaza, as Washington leads an intense diplomatic campaign to push Hamas to accept the proposal. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier held talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday. His visit comes after US President Joe Biden on May 31 outlined a three-phase ceasefire proposal from Israel that envisions a permanent end to hostilities, the release of Israeli and Palestinian prisoners, and the reconstruction of Gaza. The United States, a staunch ally of Israel, has been widely criticised for having blocked several previous UN draft resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. But Biden late last month launched a new US effort to secure a truce and hostage release. “Today, we voted for peace,” US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after the UN session. The resolution adopted by the 15-member UN Security Council, which includes China, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, the United States and the United Arab Emirates, calls on all parties to “immediately and fully implement” the ceasefire and release of the hostages, and for “all parties to fully implement its terms without delay and without condition.” The resolution says Israel has accepted the truce plan, and “calls upon Hamas to also accept it”. It also calls on “international mediators to enter into indirect negotiations regarding the implementation of these principles”, and urges “both sides to fully respect the principles of the ceasefire” and for the “full implementation” of the truce. Hamas in a statement, referring to its demands that include a permanent ceasefire in Gaz and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory said it “welcomes the Security Council resolution … (and) would like to reaffirm its readiness to cooperate with the United Nations and international mediators” to implement the ceasefire. American prisoners US officials have considered negotiating a unilateral deal with Hamas to release five American prisoners held in Gaza if ceasefire talks involving Israel fail, NBC News reported on Monday, citing unidentified US officials. The officials said Hamas would have an incentive to reach such a deal with Washington because it would strain US-Israel relations further and add pressure on the\n",
      "Summary: LONDON: The United Kingdom and Schengen countries raised millions of pounds and euros in fees from rejected visa applications from Pakistan, new research published this month shows. The analysis released by Lago Collective, a community of researchers, policymakers and designers, shows that Pakistanis spent £5.3 million on rejected UK visa applications, with close to 40 per cent applications rejected from Pakistan in 2023. The data was published in collaboration with the EUobserver, which reported that EU governments raked in €130m per year in rejected visa application fees, which were dubbed as ‘reverse remittances’. In a statement, Lago said, “These costs are just the tip of the iceberg: in most cases, applicants pay more than the basic application fee, with private agencies involved in processing visa applications and brokers providing additional services along the way. The costs of not being able to travel for business and leisure also results into significant losses for all those involved. This is surprising given the multiple ties between Pakistan, Europe and the UK. “Yet the challenges faced by Pakistani nationals to reach Europe through legal means became tragically clear a year ago when hundreds died in the Greece boat capsize. People have no choice but to resort to dangerous journeys,” Foresti added.    The analysis compiled by Marta For­e­sti and Otho Mantegazza at Lago Coll­ective showed that the total sum is likely to increase in 2024 since the visa application fee to travel to the EU will increase from 80 to 90 for adults on June 11. It also said the UK raised £44m in rejected fees, who are non-refundable regardless of the outcome. In the same year, around 50pc ofSchengen visas from Pakistan were also rejected, with €3.344m spent on applications. African and Asian countries bear 90pc of the costs for rejected Schengn visas. Although Pakistanis have the lowest rejection rate among these countries, the amount recovered from them is higher due to a higher number of applicants. For UK visa, countries with high rejection rates include Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Algeria — bearing high costs as a result (£5.4m, £4.3m and 3.6m, respectively). Visa application fees are increasing to 90 and £120 for adults in 2024. This will result in significant increases in rejected visas in 2024, further exacerbated by the emphasis on tightening migration\n",
      "Summary: Wounded Palestinians lie on beds as Gaza’s overwhelmed Al Aqsa hospital struggles to treat the injured.—Reuters pic DEIR BALAH: Hazem Farjallah wails as he lies in the Gaza hospital corridor, his head bandaged and his aunt by his side, days after he was injured by Israeli bombardment and with little prospect of adequate medical care. Hazem, 10, has not been able to speak since he was hit in the head with shrapnel during the Israeli air strike on a UN school being used as a shelter and the shrapnel wounds are visible on his back, chest and head. “He’ll never be able to walk again,” said his aunt, Umm Nasser, who has been caring for him for the past three days. His plight shows the dire condition of Gaza‘s damaged, under equipped and understaffed hospitals eight months into Israel’‘Operation Protective Edge’. Collapse of health system in the face of massive Israeli bombardment has complicated a host of disasters, from hunger to spreading disease The collapse in Gaza has been one of the most dramatic aspects of the conflict. It has left those with chronic conditions unable to access basic care. But the war has also brought sudden influxes of badly injured people to the few remaining hospitals even as they struggle to access medical supplies, overwhelming doctors and nurses coping with restricted space and terrible injuries. Some of the injured are in critical condition. In the corridors of the hospital where Hazem is lying injured, there are not even enough stands to hold up IV drips. ‘There is no room at all inside this hospital for the injured,’ said Doctor Khalil al-Dakran. There were now four or five times more injured people at the hospital than there were beds for them to use, he said. In a video obtained by Reuters, Hazem can be seen lying on the floor with a small packet of medicine in his hand. Other injured people in the hospital made the same observation and some could be seen standing with a friend or relative holding aloft the medicine pack. ”There are no beds in this hospital. There are no stretchers. There is no air-conditioning, there is no water, there isn’t anything. There was no space at all,“ said Dr Khalil Al-Dakhran. „There is absolutely no room for the wounded.

      "Summary: SINGAPORE: Pollution from man-made emissions and other sources like wildfires have been linked to around 135 million premature deaths worldwide between 1980 and 2020, a Singapore university said on Monday. Weather phenomena like El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole worsened the effects of these pollutants by intensifying their concentration in the air, Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (NTU) said, unveiling the results of a study led by its researchers. “Our findings show that changes in climate patterns can make air pollution worse,” said Steve Yim, an associate professor at NTU’�s Asian School of the Environment, who led the study. Weather patterns increased the deaths by 14 per cent, the study found. The tiny particles called particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller, which are found in the atmosphere and in the soil, are the most common source of air pollution in the world. They come from vehicle and industrial emissions as well as natural sources like fires and dust storms. The study is one of the most expansive to date on air quality and climate, using 40 years of data to give a big-picture view of the effects that air pollution has on human health, the university said in a statement on the study, published in the journal Environment International. It found that people were dying younger than the average life expectancy from diseases or conditions that could have been treated or prevented, including stroke, heart and lung disease, and cancer. The small particles, known as “particulate matter” or “PM2.5”, are harmful to human health when inhaled because they are small enough to enter the bloodstream. They are also a major cause of respiratory diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema, and can lead to premature death if inhaled. The Fine Particulate Matter (PPM) in the Air, or PM, is a mixture of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. The fine particulate form of PM is the most dangerous form of pollution. The Singapore researchers studied satellite data from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) on the levels of particulates matter in the Earth‘s atmosphere. Information on weather patterns during the period was taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States. They analysed statistics on deaths from diseases linked to pollution from\n",
      "Summary: GUWAHATI: Armed men ambushed a convoy carrying the security team of the chief minister of India’s troubled northeastern state of Manipur on Monday, wounding two people, but the leader was not with them at the time, officials said. Attackers opened fire on one vehicle in the convoy, “leading to a firefight,” a security officer said. Chief Minister N. Biren Singh was due to visit the state‘s Jiribam region on Tuesday, after violence flared there following the discovery of the body of a 59-year-old Meitei man last week. Houses in the region, two police outposts and a forest department office were torched by “unknown miscreants” following the death of the Kuki man, police said. The security team attacked on Monday was going to make “arrangements and checks” for his visit, the official said. “The assailants will be brought to justice, according to the law and order minister, who is in charge of security in the state, and we will ensure that they are held to account for their heinous act, which is a violation of human rights and the rule of law in Manipur,’’ Singh said in a statement. Fighting between Manipur’m majority MeiteI and minority Kuki communities over sharing economic benefits and quotas given to the latter has killed at least 220 people and displaced 60,000 in the last year, with sporadic clashes continuing. The state of 3.2 million people is divided into two enclaves — a valley controlled by the Meiteis and the Kuk-dominated hills, separated by a stretch of “no man’S land” monitored by federal paramilitary forces. Prime Minister Nare­ndra Modi’d Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance lost both seats in Manipu to the main opposition Congress in recent national elections — the first polls since violence began in the State. Singh still runs the state of local government for the BJP. ‘In the last one year, due to the complexity of the violence, neither the state nor central government has been able to take strong actions against the groups on both sides,‚ he told the Indian Express newspaper on Sunday. Singh also blamed the central government for failing to address the grievances of the people in the valley, who have been largely ignored by the state government.“This has led to\n",
      "Summary: OSLO: More armed conflicts took place worldwide in 2023 than any other year since the end of the Second World War, according to a Norwegian study published on Monday. Last year saw 59 conflicts of which 28 were in Africa, the the Peace Research Institute of Oslo (PRIO) showed. But the number of countries which experienced conflicts declined from 39 in 2022 to 34. The number of deaths in combat also halved to around 122,000 over the previous year, compared to data collected by Sweden’s Uppsala University from NGOs and international organisations. That number remained nonetheless the third highest since 1989, against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas movement. “Violence in the world is at an all-time high since the beginning of the Cold War. The figures suggest that the conflict landscape has become increasingly complex, with more conflict actors operating within the same country,” said Siri Aas Rustad, PRIO researcher and the main author of the report covering trends during the period 1946-2023. In addition, the past three years saw more conflict-related deaths than any time in the last three decades, with over 71,000 people killed in Ukraine, some 23,000 killed in Gaza in less than three months of 2023. The dramatic increase in battle deaths was driven by three conflicts: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the civil war in Ethiopia. The report provides an analysis of the global trends in conflict covering the period of 1946 to 2023, to help policymakers and practitioners better understand the contexts they are working in. The paper uses data collected annually by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (MINFIDA) and the Norwegian Institute for Security Studies (NISI).

      "Summary: GENEVA: The United Nations’ refugees chief on Monday denounced the politicisation of migration in European elections. Instead of demonising refugees and migrants, he says it would be wiser if countries ‘worked together’, on addressing the root causes which push people to leave their homes. Filippo Grandi told reporters that his ‘main’ concern after the weekend’s European Parliament elections, was that “the refugee-migration theme has become so politicised in these elections”. This, he said, was “partly because some politicians have manipulated it, have portrayed it as a threat, as a risk”, and “in the process, they’ve made it more difficult, to deal with.” Grandi, who is also the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) chief, said he was concerned that the issue had become “politicised” in Europe. The European elections handed significant gains to ‘far-right parties, across much of the continent. Numerous European states’ have focused on tightening migration policies. “But to simply say: this is an invasion, (of) ill-intentioned people that come here to steal your jobs, threaten your values, your security, and therefore they have to go away, we have to build barriers, this does not solve the problem,” he stated. He pointed to the ‘largely neglected’ conflict raging in Sudan, which has in recent months, spurred a “steep rise in the arrival of Sudanese refugees into North Africa, Libya, Tunisia and then across to Italy” as one of the main reasons for the surge in the number of migrants and refugees coming to Europe. Grandi acknowledged that swelling numbers of refugees and Migrants could pose significant challenges, “first and foremost for the people that are on the move, but also for those that are hosting and receiving them, for the countries, governments receiving them“. He warned that demonising the issue, and building barriers, will only make the issue more difficult to manage. ‘To build barriers actually increases irregularity of movement, it increases the risk of people being caught up in these flows, which are more dangerous, and it creates a situation which is more difficult than it was before, in terms of managing the flows which are already there, and which are much more complex, and much more complicated,�\n",

      "Summary: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday thanked the Sharif brothers for their congratulatory messages on him becoming the premier for a third time. Modi was sworn in on Sunday at a ceremony attended by leaders from Bangladesh, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. However, China and Pakistan were not present. Former PM and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif also congratulated the Indian premier. “Your party’s success in recent elections reflects the confidence of the people in your leadership,” Nawaz said in a post on X. Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered a brief congratulations to his counterpart on his re-election, almost a week after the results came in. PM Sharif and his brother Nawaz had attended the ceremony when Modi became the prime minister for the first time in 2014, a complete rarity in the history of the nuclear-armed nations. PM Nawaz also congratulated PM Modi on his victory in the general election, which was held on May 12. Hours later, PM Modi responded to the two, thanking him for his “good wishes”. To Nawaz, he said: “Appreciate your message. The people of India have always stood for peace, security and progressive ideas. Advancing the well-being and security of our people shall always remain our priority.” But the neighbours currently have minimal relations and ties have worsened during a decade under Modi, who has ramped up his Hindu nationalist agenda. Pakistan suspended bilateral trade and downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi in 2019, after Modi revoked the limited autonomy of Indian-held Kashmir in a move widely celebrated across India. Prime Minister Sharif and PM Sharif have repeatedly expressed their desire to improve ties with India. PM Modi has repeatedly said that he will work with Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir dispute. PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also congratulated Modi on the election results on Sunday, saying it was a “historic day” for the two countries and the world. But analysts say Pakistan, a sixth of the size of India, has few levers to pull. Modi “election campaign pivoted around anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan rhetoric”, Zahid Hussain, an opinion writer and author, said in an Dawn op-ed last week.    “Modi has made it clear that he does not want Muslims to have a voice in the government, he wants them to be voiceless” said Hussain. ” But\n",
      "Summary: An aircraft carrying Malawi’s Vice President Saulos Klaus Chilima and nine others has gone missing, Malawi's presidency said on Monday. “All efforts by aviation authorities to make contact with the Aircraft since it went off the radar have failed thus far,” Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera said in a statement. The aircraft had been scheduled to land at Mzuzu International Airport at 10:02am, according to the statement. It was not immediately clear what caused the aircraft to go missing, but the Malawi Defense Force said it was investigating the matter. President Lazarus Chilime has ordered regional and national forces to conduct an “immediate search and rescue operation to locate the whereabouts of the aircraft”, the statement said. Chakwara, who was due to travel to the Bahamas for a working visit, has since cancelled his trip. In 2022, the vice president was stripped of his powers when he was arrested and charged with graft over a bribery scandal involving a British-Malawian businessman. Last month, a Malawian court dropped the charges after Chilata attended several court appearances. Chiluma, 51, was aboard a Malawi Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) aircraft that left the capital Lilongwe at 09:17am, it said, adding that search and Rescue operations were ongoing. In Iran, a helicopter carrying Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other officials went missing on Sunday, the presidency said. Foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, governor of East Azerbaijan province Malek Rahmati and others were also onboard the convoy, which comprised three helicopters, of which the other two landed safely.

      "Summary: NEW DELHI: India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in on Sunday for a third term after worse-than-expected election results left him reliant on coalition partners to govern. Flanked by top BJP officials and party leaders of his coalition, Modi vowed in a ceremony marking his formal assumption of pow­er to “bear true allegiance to the constitution of India”. His office said he would appoint a 71-member cabinet, including 11 National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ally ministers. The crowd also included adoring BJP loyalists, as well as celebrities such as Bollywood legend Shah Rukh Khan and billionaire tycoons Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, key Modi allies. But with Modi yet to announce details of his cabinet, the line of lawm­a­­kers also taking the oath of office was keenly wat­ched as an indication of who will be in government. Larger coalition parties have demanded hefty concessions in exchange for their support. Other coalition leaders to take the oath included Ram Mohan Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party, the largest BJP ally with 16 seats, and which media reports has extra­cted four cabinet seats. Rajiv Ranjan Singh also took the oath, and Nitish Kumar, the leader of the largest opposition party, the Janata Dal (United) with 12 seats, which has reportedly two minister posts. The Hindus­tan Times described days of “hectic talks”, while the Times of India said the BJP had sought to ”pare down” their partners’ demands. Indian media reported widely that the top jobs including the four most powerful posts of the interior, foreign, finance and defence would remain in the hands of the BJP, and that the smaller coalition parties would have to give up some of their demands in return for the support of the larger parties. ‘More consultation’ But analysts said that the coalition would shift parliamentary politics and force Modi‘s once domineering BJP into a somewhat more conciliatory approach. “The coalition will now force the BJP to engage in more consultation.” Political analyst Zoya Hasan of Jawaharlal Neh­ru University said Modi faced potential challenges ahead, warning he may be “meeting his match” in the “crafty politicians” of the TDP’sg Chandrababu Naiden and JD(U)\n",
      "Summary: WASHINGTON: The Biden administration is close to finalising a treaty with Saudi Arabia that would commit the US to help defend the Gulf nation as part of a deal aimed at encouraging diplomatic ties between Riyadh and Israel, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing US and Saudi officials. Approval of the treaty, which the WSJ said would be known as the Strategic Alliance Agreement, would require a two-thirds majority vote in the US Senate, a threshold that would be difficult to achieve unless the treaty were tied to Israeli-Saudi normalisation. The White House, the US State Department and the Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The draft treaty is modelled loosely on Washing­ton’s mutual security pact with Japan, the Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. The possible deal, widely telegraphed by US and other officials for weeks, is part of the wider package that would include a US-Saudi civil nuclear pact, steps toward the establishment of a Palestinian state and an end to the Israeli aggression in Gaza, where months of ceasefire efforts have failed to bring peace. It is also intended to bind Riyadh closer to Washington by prohibiting China from building bases in the kingdom or pursuing security cooperation with Riyadh, the WS Journal quoted officials as saying. In exchange for the US commitment to helping defend Saudi Arabia if it were attacked, the draft treaty would grant Washinga­ton access to Saudi territory and airspace to protect US interests and regional partners, the newspaper reported. It would also require Saudi Arabia to take steps toward normalising relations with Israel, which have been strained by the conflict in the Gaza Strip.

Authorities claim the driver lost control of the bus after it came under attack by ‘militants’ Sunday’s attack comes a day after police chief RR Swain said the number of local fighters in the territory was dropping but 70-80 ‘foreigners’ remained active. News of the attack came as Narendra Modi took oath as prime minister for a record-equalling third term and drew criticism from the main opposition Congress party. “Militants ambushed the bus and fired at it indiscriminately. The bus fell into a gorge, leading to the death of 9 pilgrims, and 23 are injured,” said Mohita Sharma, district police chief of Reasi. A state official earlier said at least 10 pilgrims were feared dead. Opposition Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge condemned the  “gruesome terror attack” in a post on social media platform X. Nine people died and 23 were  injured. The injured have been moved to nearby hospitals and a search for the attackers has been launched, a police official said. The last major attack on Hindu pilgrims in the occupied region where a bus was targeted, killing eight people.“Initial reports suggest that militants were waiting there in an ambush and they fired on the bus, while the driver was on his way to the shrine of Lord Hanuman, which is a popular pilgrimage destination for Hindus,’’ the official said, adding that the bus driver had lost control and fell into the deep gorge. The crash happened near Reasi town, in the south of the occupied territory, as the bus was returning from a popular Hindu shrine in the area. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi called the attack a “shameful” and “horrific” incident. Modi’�s “chest-thumping propaganda of bringing peace and normalcy… rings hollow”, he said. But the vote saw a 58.6 per cent turnout, according to the election commission, a 30-percentage-point jump from the last vote in 2019 and the highest in 35 years. Five fighters and an Indian air force corporal were killed in clashes since election campaigning began in the Territory in April until voting ended this month.\n",
      "Summary: SEOUL: South Korea resumed loudspeaker broadcasts directed at North Korea on Sunday, its military said, following through on a warning demanding Pyongyang stop sending balloons carrying trash into the South. The broadcasts were made on Sunday afternoon and whether more will follow depends on how North Korea responds, South Korea’s military said. It gave no other details. The decision to resume the broadcasts, as a form of psychological warfare, was made after North Korea began launching on Satu­rday about 330 balloons with trash attached, with about 80 of them dropping over the border, the South Korean Defence Ministry said in a statement. The South Korean military said that more balloons had been launched by the North and could fly into the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the North from the South, and warned residents to not touch any objects they find attached to balloons. S. Korea had warned the North it would take retaliatory measures which cou­ld include propaganda broadcasts from huge loudspeakers set up at the border. “The measures we will take may be unbearable for the North Korean regime but they will send a message of hope and hope to the North’ s people and its people,” the statement from the National Security Council said. Seoul has said it will respond to any provocation by North Korea by sending a hundred times the amount of trash it sends across the DMZ, and has said the move was in retaliation for anti-North leaflets flown by South Korean activists as part of a propaganda campaign. On June 2, it said it would temporarily halt sending the balloons beca­use 15 tons of trash its sent was probably enough to get the message across. How­ever, it vowed to resume if leaflets are again flown from the North. A group of South Korean scientists and activists defied the warning and have since flown more balloons to the north with leaflets criticising its leader Kim Jong Un together with USB sticks containing K-pop videos and dramas, and US dollar notes.

      "Summary: PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday announced he was dissolving parliament and called snap legislative elections after the far-right trounced his centrist alliance in EU polls. The first round of elections for the lower house National Assembly will take place on June 30, with the second round on July 7, Macron announced in an address to the nation. “Far right parties... are progressing everywhere in the continent. It is a situation to which I cannot resign myself,” he said. The outcome of the EU elections, he acknowledged, is  “not a good result for parties who defend Europe”.  Macron noted that, including the top scorers of the European People’s Party (EPP) and the French National Rally (RN), right-wing parties in France managed to take almost 40 per cent of the vote in the European Parliament elections, compared with less than 10 per cent for the centrist alliance led by his National Front (FN) party in France. Macron warned on Thursday that the EU risked being  \"blocked” by a big far­right presence in the Euro­pean Parliament after this week's elections. He said he had no choice but to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections for June 30-July 7, 2018, in order to give the French people a chance to make the best choice for itself and future generations.“This is not an easy decision, but it is an act of confidence. Confidence in you, dear compatriots, and in the capacity of the French public,’’ he said in his televised address to a joint session of parliament. ‘I decided to give you the choice... Therefore I will dissolve parliament tonight.’ “This decision is serious and heavy but it must be taken.” “I cannot wait any longer for the next elections. ”  The RN’m list, led by Jordan Bardella, 28, gained between 32.3 and 33pc of the win compared with 14.8 to 15.2pc for Macron’S alliance led of his Renaissance party, according to projections from several polling firms.

      "Summary: JERUSALEM: A ban on Al Jazeera‘s operations in Israel was extended for another 45 days by Israel’s telecoms regulator on Sunday after the cabinet agreed its broadcasts posed a threat to security. In a separate ruling on a petition by Al Jazeera against the ban, the Tel Aviv High Court said the ban was “unjustified” and that it should not be upheld. The network”s broadcasts on the cable and satellite companies and access to its websites will remain blocked for another two months, the regulator said in a statement. A Tel Aviv court last week upheld an initial 35-day ban on al Jazeera operations in Israeli, imposed by the government on national security grounds, which ended on Saturday. The Channel 2 news channel said it planned to appeal the latest ban extension. Al Jazeera had told the court it did not incite violence or terrorism and that the ban is disproportionate, court documents showed. The channel, which is owned by Qatar, has said it will continue to air its news programmes in Israel. The high court described the measure against the Qatari-backed broadcaster channel as  “precedent-setting”. It gave Israel's government until Aug 8 to offer arguments for  ”why it should be determined that the Law Preventing a Foreign Broadcaster from Harming National Security” is void.

      "Summary: RIYADH: Oil giant Saudi Aramco said on Sunday that international investors had snatched up the bulk of shares sold in its latest offering, which was set to raise $11.2 billion. Aramco, the mostly state-owned jewel of the Saudi economy, announced on May 30 that it would sell 1.545 billion shares, or approximately 0.64pc of its issued shares, on the Saudi stock exchange. “The majority of the shares constituting the institutional tranche of the Offering was allocated to investors located outside of the Kingdom,” the company said in a statement before the Saudi bourse reopened on Sunday. Sources close to the situation said that around 58 per cent of shares were allocated to international investors, up from around 23pc for the company’s initial public offering in 2019 which was the biggest flotation in history. The sources said around 70pc of orders outside the local market came from the European Union and the United States, while others came from Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The secondary offering was expected to provide a short-term boost to Saudi Arabia‘s finances as the Gulf kingdom builds large-scale projects including resorts and stadiums, part of a reform drive to prepare for an eventual post-oil future. It was widely seen as a test of foreign investor interest more than halfway through the kingdom’m campaign known as Vision 2030, whose ambitions are reflected in so-called giga-projects such as NEOM, a planned futuristic megacity in the desert. Demand ‘stronger’ About 10pc of the stakes in the secondary offering were offered to retail investors, drawing 1.3 million subscribers to the Saudi Stock Exchange, while the rest were sold to institutional investors, who were allocated a total of 1.2 million shares, the company added. One source close to Aramco who was not authorised to speak to the media, said that retail coverage was 3.7 times and that total demand from institutional and retail investors was worth over $65 billion. The source said it appeared to be the largest secondary offering in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region since 2000, the largest equity capital market transaction globally since 2021, and the largest offering in Saudi Arabia since Aramco’’ IPO in 2019, which ultimately raised $29.4 billion.

      "Summary: ZURICH: Swiss voters backed legislation to promote renewable energy in a referendum on Sunday, while rejecting separate proposals intended to contain rising healthcare insurance costs. Seeking to enhance energy independence, the federal law passed in autumn 2023 comprises measures to boost the transport, storage and production of electricity, including facilitating the installation of solar panels on buildings. It also includes provisions to fund these measures. The energy law, which was put to a referendum by opponents who argued it would be too costly and was not fit for purpose, was backed by more than two-thirds of voters, preliminary results and projections published by public broadcaster SRF showed. It is now expected to take effect next year. Two separate initiatives were defeated that either sought to tie health insurance contributions to income levels or put curbs on increases in the levy, the results showed. The proposals to contain health insurance costs had enjoyed majority support earlier in the campaign, polls showed. Critics of the health plans had argued they risked sparking higher taxes, just as the government grapples with how to fund additional pension payments that are due to come into effect in 2026 and were backed by Swiss voters in March. Switzerland has been at loggerheads over climate change with a top European court, which in April ruled it was not doing enough to combat global warming. The European Commission, which has been trying to persuade the Swiss government to take more action to combat climate change, has said it will not accept the court’s ruling.

      "Summary: MARSEILLE: A prisoner escaped from detention in southern France after casting his ballot in European elections on Sunday, a prison source and prosecutors said. The prisoner, who was held in a jail in the southern city of Arles,  “was on supervised leave” to exercise his right to vote, the source said. He fled as he was leaving the polling station, at the moment when he was supposed to be getting into a vehicle that was to take him back to the jail, the sources said, adding that the man was “known for his calm demeanour”. The man had initially been sentenced to a  three-year term for drug trafficking, then to eight years for pimping, the public prosecutor’s office said. French authorities are still hunting for a group of gunmen who killed two prison officers in an attack in mid-May that freed a convict linked to gangland drug killings. The convict, Mohamed Amra, also remains at large despite an international alert issued by Interpol. He was accompanied by a probation officer and a prison guard, according to prosecutors and a spokesman for the prison guard union at the Arles prison. The prison guard said Amra had been released from prison on Friday and was being held at a detention centre in the northern city of Toulouse. He is believed to be in his mid-30s. In a statement late on Saturday, the FO Justice union in Arles said the prisoner was due to be released in 2026 and  ”was known for his mild demeanours” and “a good person” who was known to be calm. “Nothing suggested such an escape as he approached the end of his sentence,” said the union.

      "Summary: Voters in 21 EU countries, including France and Germany, cast their ballots on Sunday in an election for the European Parliament that is expected to shift the assembly to the right and boost the numbers of eurosceptic nationalists. Voting began on Thursday in the Netherlands and in other countries on Friday and Saturday, but the bulk of EU votes will be cast on Sunday, with France, Germany, Poland and Spain opening the polls and Italy holding a second day of voting. The European Parliament will issue an EU-wide exit poll at around 8:30pm Central European Time (CET) and then a first provisional result after 11:00pm CET when the final votes, in Italy, have been cast. Parliament as a whole will also vote and often amend a slew of legislation expected in the next five years. The election will shape how the European Union, a bloc of 450 million citizens, confronts challenges including a hostile Russia, increased industrial rivalry from China and the United States, climate change and immigration. The shift right means it may be less enthusiastic on climate change policies and the reforms required for EU enlargement, while eager on measures to limit immigration. “Whoever believes that we need a change of course and that things can be done much better in Brussels has only one alternative, which is Vox,” the leading candidate for the far-right Rassemblement National will trounce French President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Renaissance in France. At a polling station in northern Paris, 18-year-old student Elisa Dubois said she was concerned about the rise of the far right across Europe. In the Netherlands, exit polls on Thursday showed nationalist Geert Wilders’ anti-immigration party was set to win seven of the 29 Dutch seats in the European parliament. The expected losses by pro-European liberals and Greens, will reduce the majority of the centre-right and centre-left in the EU parliament, which has been in power for more than two decades, to a minority. European Greens, facing a backlash from hard-pressed households, farmers and industry over costly EU policies limiting CO2 emissions, look set to be among the big losers with the poll on Sunday giving them only 56 deputies, a loss of 16. Forecasts for the liberal group Renew Europe are also grim, given the expectation that Marine Le Pen and her National Front (FN) party will win a majority of seats in France and the Netherlands.

The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said that at least 36,801 people have been killed in the territory in Israeli strikes since the conflict began in October.—AFP picGAZA CITY, GAZA: Israel pressed its bombardment of Gaza as strikes rattled various neighbourhoods and appeared to be focused on central areas of the Palestinian territory. The onslaught persisted, despite scrutiny on Israel after its warplanes carried out an attack on a UN-run school that a Gaza hospital said killed at least 37 people. The Israeli military acknowledged it conducted the strike on the Nuseirat refugee camp, saying it targeted “terrorists”. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees that ran the school, condemned Israel for striking the facility housing 6,000 displaced people. In a post on X, the agency said the “school turned shelter” had been hit without prior warning. “Targeting UN premises or using for military purposes cannot become the new norm. This must stop and all those responsible be held accountable,” it said.

So we checked and found women and children in pieces. What did the children and women do wrong? They are defenceless people, they are not terrorists.” “The Israeli occupation is killing civilians, it is killing children, women and men, and it’s killing them in the name of fighting terrorism, but it is not killing them because they are civilians, they’re not terrorists, they have no weapons, they don’t have anything to do with terrorism, they just want to live, they want to go to school, and they are just trying to get by.

Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces in the eight months since the Gaza conflict began, triggered by Hamas’ October 7 raid. The deadly clashes have intensified in recent weeks, causing multiple brush fires on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border. More than eight months of border violence, which began on October 8, has killed 458 people in Leba­non, mostly fighters but including about 90 civilians, according to a tally.

      "Summary: WASHINGTON/LONDON: Thousands of protesters held a “red line” rally near the White House on Saturday, voicing anger at US President Joe Biden’s apparent support for Israel. While Biden has faced criticism for playing a balancing act on key ally Israel’ actions in the conflict, the white House said last month that a deadly Israeli strike on Rafah did not cross a ‘red line,’ that Biden had seemingly set two months earlier when asked about a potential invasion of the southern Gaza city. “I no longer believe any of the words that Joe Biden says,” said protester 25-year-old Zaid Mahdawi from Virginia, whose parents are Palestinian. The demonstration was organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Chanting “From DC to Palestine, we are the red line“, the demonstrators held a long banner scribbled with the names of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces. Nursing assistant Tala McKinney, 25, said: “We’re not going to stand for this anymore.” The White House stepped up security with an anti-scale perimeter fence ahead of the demonstration. The protesters — almost all wearing red clothing — held Palestinian flags and signs saying “Biden's red line was a lie” and “Bombing children is not self-defence. It is a war crime”, and called for a permanent ceasefire in the brutal military campaign against Hamas. In London thousands of people marched through the city centre to parliament calling for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza. The march was led by a group of students from the University of East Anglia. Marchers waved Palestinian flags in solidarity with the Palestinian people. ‘Red line’ is rubbish’, says protester ZaidMahdawi, who said Biden had set a red line that was not being met by the Israeli military.

      "Summary: WASHINGTON: William Anders, the former US astronaut who took the historic  “Earthrise” photo from space over 55 years ago, died in a plane crash on Friday at the age of 90, his family said. Anders had been piloting a small plane which crashed off the coast of Washington state on Friday morning, his son told US media. A member of the Apollo 8 mission in December 1968, Anders became one of the first humans to orbit the Moon, along with fellow Americans Frank Borman and James Lovell. The crew circled the Moon 10 times without landing, before successfully returning to Earth on Dec 27, 1968. Anders was alone in the plane. His body was later recovered by a dive team, The Seattle Times reported, quoting a Coast Guard spokesperson. The San Juan County Sheriff’s Office in Washington state said in a statement that local authorities received a report around noon on Friday that an older model plane was flying from north to south then went into the water and sunk. “In 1968, during Apollo 8, Bill Anders offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give,” Nasa chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media platform X.   . “He traveled to the threshold of the Moon and helped all of us see something else: ourselves. He embodied the lessons and the purpose of exploration. We will miss him, ” Nelson added. Anders, who was also the first American to fly on the International Space Station (ISS), was one of three astronauts to fly to the Moon on the first manned mission to the lunar surface, which was known as the “Apollo 11” mission, and the second manned mission, which flew in 1969, to the surface of the moon. On one of lunar orbits, Anders captured a photo of the bright blue Earth against the vast darkness of space, with the Moon’�s cratered surface in the foreground. The photo became an iconic image of space travel.  The photo was taken by Anders on Dec 26, 1968 “We’d been going backwards and upside down, didn’t really see the Earth or the Sun, and when we rolled around and came around and saw the first Earthrise, it was the first time I’ve ever seen the Earthrise in my life, and I was very, very excited about it.” “(T)hat certainly was, by far, the most impressive thing.\n",

      "Summary: RIYADH: Saudi Arabia said on Saturday that security forces had cleared hundreds of thousands of unregistered pilgrims from Makkah ahead of Haj which begins next week. Crowd management is a major concern during the annual pilgrimage, which drew over 1.8m people last year, according to official figures. Those turned away in recent days from the holy city, include 153,998 foreigners who travelled from abroad on tourist visas rather than the required Haj visas, the official Saudi Press Agency said. Over 1.3m registered pilgrims had arrived for Haj as of Saturday, Saudi authorities said. The Haj, which begins on June 14, involves a series of rituals completed over several days in the city of Mecca. Many seek to complete the rites through unofficial channels. Large crowds have proved hazardous in the past during the Haj, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the “stoning the devil” ritual in Mina, near Makkaf, killed up to 2,300 people in the deadliest-ever tragedy during the pilgrimage. Fears of a repeat have spurred Saudi officials to crack down on off-the-books pilgrims. The Saudi Interior Ministry said in a statement on Friday that authorities had cleared more than 1,000,000 people from the city, including 1,200,000 foreigners who did not have required Haj permits, and 1,500,000 others who were not registered. In addition, 30,000 unregistered foreigners have been rounded up 171,587 others who are based in Saudi Arabia but are not residents of Saudi Arabia and did not apply for a Haj permit, SPA said.

      "Summary: By  Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. The $449 Sonos Ace headphones are hitting their June 5th launch target. Was it worth it? In my first look at the Ace, I applauded their hardware design and premium feel. And I’ve remained impressed over the course of reviewing them. Sonos has nailed style, fit, and comfort to such an extent that I keep forgetting these are a debut product in a new category for the company. The Ace headphones come in a felt-covered case that’s made from recycled plastics. Inside is a pouch that attaches to the case magnetically: this is where you’ll store the included USB-C and USB-A-to-3.5mm cables. (Wired listening is possible with either cable.) The Ace look like a blend of the 1000XM5 and Apple AirPods Max. They’re understated yet stylish. The embossed Sonos logo on the right ear cup calls little attention and is easy to miss in most lighting. The stainless steel slider arms allow for precise fit adjustments — though, as usual, my giant head requires full extension. And the magnetic memory foam ear cushions just pull right off if you ever need to replace them. The headphones are 0.69 pounds, but the airy feel of BComfort Headband is noticeably lighter than Sony’S WH-1000XM5. The insides are different colors to help you orient the headphones, but I‘ve found it easier to just remember that the metal Content Key slider always goes on the left side. And damn, are they comfortable.  But true to the state of Sonos in mid-2024, the Ace headphones can be buggy. They also largely deliver on sound quality, noise cancellation, and a transparency mode — but they don’t always work the way Sonos wants them to work. That‘s all before you get to the signature trick of these headphones: TV Audio Swap.

Solar generators and battery-powered fridges are highly desirable additions to vans, boats, cabins, and sheds, or anywhere power and refrigeration is needed off the grid.  Bluetti just started shipping its SwapSolar kit that pairs an AC180T solar generator with its MultiCooler,a 3-in-1 solar-powered fridge, freezer, and ice maker. The SwapSolar B70 battery at the heart of these systems holds 716.8Wh of energy and is built using LFP chemistry. LFP — short for lithium iron phosphate — batteries last longer, are safer, and work in a wider range of operating temperatures than the smaller and lighter NMC-based batteries they’re rapidly replacing.  This modular approach has some other interesting benefits, too: Building a modular ecosystem of products around small interchangeable batteries has already seen success by makers of handheld power tools. Bluetti is expanding the concept to devices needed for extended off-grid living, with more SwapSolar products coming.  Great, but first we need to see if the devices shipping today can independently justify the total price of the $2,000 SwapSolar kit.  Editor’d note: When this review was finished, we went back to take one last photo and discovered that the MultiCoolner would not turn on for reasons explained below. We are therefore withholding its score until Bluetti can assure us it’�s not a widespread defect.  The Multicooler is powered by two B70 LFP batteries, which can be charged inside the main compartment of the unit when plugged into a 12V socket, a standard power outlet, or solar panels. What makes this kit interesting is that Bluetti has developed a way to charge the B70 batteries in the same way that you can charge your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. The B70 should hold 80 percent of its original charging capacity, even after 3,000 cycles. The 3-In-1 Multifunctional Fridge, Ice Maker, and Refrigerator is a little different than the Solar Generator I reviewed last year. The AC\n",
      "Summary: By  Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News. Controller for HomeKit, a third-party app for controlling your Apple Home smart home, has a new Floor Plan feature that adds a map interface for interacting with connected devices like lights, locks, shades, sensors and more. A 3D scan of your house becomes an interactive map filled with all your connected devices providing an intuitive way to control them: Just tap the lamp next to the sofa on the map and that light will turn on. The floor plans include furniture, windows, doors, and dimensions, which made it easy to see where to add the icons for each device I wanted to place on the floor plan.  The Floor Plan is part of a paid subscription and requires a LIDAR-enabled iPhone or iPad. I got some time with the new feature ahead of its launch this week and I’m impressed with how easy it is to use and how much it’ll change the way you interact with your smart home. Controlling gadgets on a map feels more intuitive than the current clunky state of voice control and is more visual than most of today‘s app-based controls. Because of this ease of use, map view is becoming a popular control method for the home; both Amazon Alexa and Samsung SmartThings added a similar interface to their smart home control apps last year.  Floor Plan arrives with version 7.0.0 of the Controller Pro, which also brings a complete redesign to the app, putting the new control feature front and center.   For those unfamiliar, Controller for homeKit is a well-regarded app that can manage and control any Apple Home and HomeKit compatible devices, scenes, automations, and so on. It uses the HomeKit framework meaning it works exactly like the Apple Home app, but it offers more complex automations and advanced notifications than the Home app. This makes it a good option for those who like Apple Home but find Apple’�s own app too limited.  1/3    I had given the app permission to my HomeKit devices, so it could select my homeKit scenes, sensors, lights, and other devices as well as to add them to the map view. The scanning feature is powered by Apple”s RoomPlan, a Swift API that uses\n",

Buying a 3D printer is buying an entire hobby, one where — if you’re a lazy bum like me — many attempts will turn into worthless gobs of plastic. But if you persisted, I’d tell you my one clear choice for lazy bums: the Bambu P1P.  It makes my stalwart old Ender 3 Pro look like a hunk of junk. It makes its closest competition, the $559 Creality K1C, feel like an inferior clone. What, a printer from the company that recalled its newest model and whose earlier ones once went rogue? Yep — because not only did Bambus handle those incidents with rapid apologies, investigations, transparency, and even refunds, the P1ip is also absolutely the easiest, most reliable 3D printers I‘ve used. I took delivery of both the P2P and the original K1 last summer, and originally, I was going to be comparing both to the Anker M3, the MakerBot M4, and the M5. All of these are full-size, full-featured CoreXY printers that claim you can print right out of the box — with no need to bolt together a printer frame or even tighten belts. And while you can’t “just start printing the moment your K1 arrives,” as Creality puts it, both printers are mostly prebuilt, pretuned, and ready to go 20 or 30 minutes after you cut the packing tape. You remove a few safety pieces; attach their screens, power cables, and filament roll holders; connect to your home network for updates; and then press a button for automated setup.  Each will automatically level their bed so your prints literally get off on the right foot. They tune their motors with vibrations so intense, they shake the entire surface the printers are standing on. That’s intentional — because excess movement ruins prints, and printing quickly creates more movement, they teach themselves to avoid frequencies that rattle too hard. As I alluded to before, they both have CoreXY kinematics systems that provide an incredibly speedy\n",
      "Summary: By  Thomas Ricker, a deputy editor and Verge co-founder with a passion for human-centric cities, e-bikes, and life as a digital nomad. He’s been a tech journalist for almost 20 years. The ID Buzz has always been a showstopper when driving past onlookers — now, the show continues when the doors open to reveal that wonderfully adaptive Ventje interior. Swoon. And let me tell you, this is definitely a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Volkswagen’m not the only automaker that has built a custom camper for its all-electric microbus, but the ID Buzz is arguably less flexible — than the electric microbus. That long delay since European sales began in 2022 has made room for a burgeoning aftermarket for ID Buzz camper products, including the excellent and relatively inexpensive Ququq camping box I previously reviewed. I first tested a Ventje camper built on top of a VW Transporter T5 cargo van in 2022, before living and working from an ID Buzz for a few weeks in 2023. In 2024, I finally got to test the union of the two for a weekend.  The eVentje can sleep four but is currently highway legal for only two people. Nevertheless, my wife and I didn’t want for more space, even with the dog coming along on the trip. The overall design of the Ventje Camper still relies on more than 100 magnets to keep all those wooden surfaces aligned and locked in place. Only now, things have been refined throughout with one big addition: a folding table and hidden stools to create an outside bar. The kitchen has seen several improvements that provide more adaptable prep surfaces — always a challenge in a small space — and smarter use of storage. There are also more lighting options including dimmable LED light strips and a closable sunroof in the pop-top tent. Ventje also moved to not one but two induction cooktops thanks to the inclusion of a 2200W inverter and 2160Wh lithium-ion battery that charges from the VW’‘s driving battery, a 350-watt solar panel, and a mini shore-power outlet located on the lower backside of the van.  1/281/28 The Ventje is the first of its kind to be built on a van, and it’\n",

Portable solar generators are so useful that you increasingly see them at the beach, campground, job site, or anywhere without access to grid power. They can lower your energy bills and ensure a modicum of home backup in the event of a power outage. But they’re also an expensive luxury if shoved into storage as soon as you return home.  These DIY systems from EcoFlow, Anker, and others became very popular around Europe over the last few years as energy costs soared amid steadily decreasing solar and battery prices.  Plug-in systems are built around a microinverter that feeds solar energy back into the home via a standard wall jack. The solar panels can be leaned up against a terrace wall, placed in a garden, or hung off a balcony railing. The battery is entirely optional if you just want to feed every watt of solar power produced back into your home. EcoFlow has a solar generator called the PowerStream, which is a $200-ish box that connects to your solar panels and a battery. The PowerStream has three proprietary ports: one that connects directly to your MC4 solar panels; one that plugs to your battery; and one AC output that plugs into a wall socket. Any solar excess not used immediately by the home can be diverted into the solar generator‘s big-ass battery for use later.  I’ve been testing an EcoFlow PowerStream setup in my own home, where I have a pair of $2,599 EcoFlow Delta Pro solar panels on my roof, and a $1,500 PowerStream box. I also have six EcoFlow smart plugs attached to things like the washing machine, coffee maker, and home theater projector that tell the powerStream to send more or less power. The result is a system that can generate up to 489W of power from the solar panels, which EcoFlow says is enough to cover the total demand of the home. It’ll also charge your Delta Pro battery for up to 10 years. To understand how the power delivery works, I took a series of screen recordings taken from the\n",

Previously, she worked at DPReview. If you buy something from a Verge urchin, we may earn a commission. Hear me out: out of Google’s entire Pixel lineup, the A-series budget phone makes the most sense. The Pixel 8A arrives six months after the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, which works to its advantage. It’ll be the first time you’re going to be able to use a phone with your day of my day again and again again and never have any problems. And it will be one of the least expensive phones when that time is over. When you consider that it has almost all of the core features of the $799 Pixel 8, it starts looking like even more of a bargain. And with seven years of software updates promised? It‘s hard to beat that kind of ROI.  I spent a few busy travel days using the Pixel8A and never once had to think about the battery. Even with a lot more social media scrolling than usual, plus navigation and Uber rides, the battery still had plenty in the tank by the end of the day. Like its predecessor, the 8A comes with Qi wireless charging. It doesn’t fold in half. I love to drop my phone onto a charging stand at the same time, so I’m happy to see it’d be possible to do this with a phone like this. The plastic back panel has a frosty matte finish, and I have great news about the new aloe color option: it rules.  The screen is the same as the Pixel 7A, but the resolution has been bumped up to 1080p from 720p. This year, the screen has been upgraded to a top refresh rate of 120Hz. Motion on the screen like scrolling and animations looks much smoother than on a standard 60Hz or even the 90Hz screen on the7A, so this feels like an update with real impact. The 8A’ screen is not the best screen in the class — that belongs to the OnePlus 12R. But it has two things working in its favor: time and money. As for the time, the Pixel has been around for a few months now, and it has been updated to the latest version of Android Oreo, which means it can handle\n",

I’m from England, where BBQ means grilling burgers and steak in the garden on a gas grill. So, when I moved to South Carolina over a decade ago, I had no clue what pulled pork was or that brisket was even a thing. I learned quickly.  Today, barbecue is one of my favorite dishes — brisket from Lewis Barbecue in Charleston is what I would request for a last meal. However, while I fancy myself as something of an accomplished home chef, I have never had much luck smoking my own meats. I do have an outdoor smoker, but it rarely gets used. Smoking meat is akin to religion around these parts, and I suspect many pitmasters would view the latest gadget I‘ve been testing as something akin to heresy. The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is an excellent gadget for smoking meats, veggies, and more from the comfort of your kitchen. While it didn’t handle the more classic BBQ cuts as well as I'd hoped, if you love that smokey flavor and don't have room for an outdoor machine, it's a great — if expensive — option.  A smart indoor smoker, GE Profile's gadget promises an easier, quicker way to cook your food with smoke.  Its main tricks are being small enough to fit on your countertop, easy to clean, and easy to keep clean. Unlike a true outdoor wood-pellet smoker, the smart indoor Smoker uses a separate heating element that does most of the hard work while the smoke infuses it with flavor. This significantly cuts down on cooking time and means you use way fewer wood pellets. Purists might scoff, but this is the only option if you want to smoke meat indoors, though, this is a very good way to do it. It’ll cook anything in under an hour — in the two months I tested it, I used it at least twice a week, far more often than I use my outdoor smoker. I have a lot of countertop space or somewhere you can store it in when it‘s not use. But I did\n",

But do you know what else the company has always been damn good at? Portable speakers. I can still remember being wowed by the original SoundLink Mini (and later, its successor). Something about Bose’s magic sauce audio processing can make these relatively tiny speakers sound much bigger and broader than they really are, and that’ve remained true with the more recent SoundLink Flex — which remains one of our favorite picks. Now, Bose has introduced a larger speaker, the new SoundLink Max, that takes after the Flex in style while adding key improvements. Size-wise, especially with the handle, it feels like a lunchbox: a very thick 4.9-pound lunchbox of sound wrapped in silicone with a metal faceplate. You can get some real swinging force with the removable handle, which can be swapped for other colors or a longer shoulder strap. Look, all I’m saying is this thing could absolutely be a weapon if you ever needed it to be. The speaker has an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. It’ll even float should you accidentally drop it in a pool. That said, its rear ports are left uncovered and exposed to the elements, so you‘ll want to dry the Max off and let it sit for a while before plugging it in. The silicone that wraps around the sides and back is resilient, but the tradeoff is that it‘s a dust and lint magnet.  At 4.73 inches high, 10.42 inches wide, and 4.13 inches deep, the Max’re enclosure is noticeably bigger and beefier than the Flex’ s, and it feels more impact more than it does at first glance. Once I started playing music, I was quickly struck by the remarkably wide soundstage it can produce. This is one of those speakers where if you close your eyes, your brain will be convinced that sounds are coming from well beyond the device’d physical footprint. And the bass carries plenty of punch. Some people might find the default EQ a tad bright\n",

Fourteen-inch gaming laptops are the best gaming laptops. There are compromises: their size limits how much power they can handle before the components melt into goo, they have loud cooling fans, and they can’t match the battery life of thinner, lighter non-gaming laptops. But they’re the right compromises for a gaming laptop that can also be your lecture hall or coffee shop laptop. They can run most PC games over 60fps on high settings, but at under four pounds and less than an inch thick, they can be a little too heavy to carry around. Razer’s Blade 14 is a small spec bump over the previous generation. The $2,700 Blade I tested comes with an AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS, RTX 4070, 32GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. The Zephyrus — one of our longtime favorites — has a redesigned chassis and new OLED panel, while the Blade 14 has the same CPU, GPU, and storage. It made sense to pit them against each other in a benchmark brawl. The Razer Blade 14 and Asus ROG Zephephyrus G14 are two of the most highly regarded 14-inch Gaming laptops. The Blade outperformed the 4070zephyrus by between 9 and 18 percent in every benchmark, despite having the very same CPU and GPU and the same amount of memory. At 1080p on the highest presets, all three can push over 60 fps in most games. Cyberpunk 2077 is an outlier if ray tracing is enabled and DLSS 3.5 is off — but turning DLSS on more than triples the frame rate. The difference between the two gaming laptops is that the Razer Blade is a little lighter than an LED laptop, but it’d be a lot harder for a 14- to 14’er gaming laptop to keep up with a 15- or 16-inch laptop. Razer gave the Blade a much lighter board board board that is sold that is 0.70 inches to the MacBook Pro, and the lid it compared it 0.7 inches to a MacBook Pro’ s lid,\n"

Sauber had brought a new rear wing this weekend with a reduced flap and redesigned main plane for the low-drag requirements of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, which also came with a different beam wing, but the Swiss team has now gone back to an older design. Bottas\\' car has also been fitted with a third energy store and a third set of control electronics, breaching the maximum allocation of two components allowed for the season. That would have netted the Finn a grid penalty, but that has now been absorbed by the pitlane start.
