Gary Neville makes questionable Liverpool prediction again – “Bookmark this”,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/gary-neville-makes-questionable-liverpool-prediction-again-bookmark-this/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Gary Neville has stirred controversy by predicting that Manchester United will finish above Liverpool in the upcoming season. With uncertainty surrounding Liverpool's new manager, Arne Slot, and their lack of signings, fans are left questioning the team's prospects. In contrast, Manchester United has already spent £141 million on transfers, raising questions about Erik ten Hag's future. During a discussion on Sky’s Stick to Football podcast, Neville expressed doubt about Liverpool making the top four, suggesting that Tottenham could be a surprise contender. He acknowledged that he often makes incorrect predictions, which adds to the entertainment of the season. Neville also raised concerns about the impact of missing out on key players, like Martin Zubimendi, on Liverpool's squad morale. Despite his predictions, the upcoming season remains uncertain, and fans are eager to see how it unfolds.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 14:16:15+0000
Liverpool pursuing Giorgi Mamardashvili deal – won’t join first team this summer,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/liverpool-pursuing-giorgi-mamardashvili-deal-wont-join-first-team-this-summer/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Liverpool's interest in goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has intensified, according to a reliable Merseyside reporter. The 23-year-old has impressed for Georgia at the Euros and has been a standout performer for Valencia over the past three seasons. His name has been linked to Liverpool as a potential successor to Alisson, which indicates strategic squad planning by the club. Reports suggest that while Liverpool has increased their interest, Mamardashvili is unlikely to join this season and may remain at Valencia for another year or two. The club believes that his estimated price tag of around £30 million would be a good investment. Personal terms have reportedly been agreed, and Mamardashvili is interested in the move, even if it requires a wait. This situation raises questions about the futures of Alisson and Caoimhin Kelleher, as well as current transfer priorities. There are various options for Mamardashvili's potential transfer, including a loan agreement with Valencia. Overall, this deal reflects Liverpool's long-term planning rather than immediate needs.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 12:12:57+0000
“Loving life” or end of an era? How Man City and Arsenal fans predict the 2024/25 season,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/loving-life-or-end-of-an-era-how-man-city-and-arsenal-fans-predict-the-2024-25-season/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Man City and Arsenal are the favourites to challenge for the Premier League title ahead of Liverpool this season. Pep Guardiola’s side won a fourth consecutive league crown last time around, but the gap at the top was only two points. Arsenal have done good business this summer, and a drop-off from City could allow the Gunners to end their two-decade title drought. The mood among Arsenal fans is optimistic, with a renewed sense of hope that this season could finally see them end their Premier League drought. They have added new players to their squad, which is seen as a significant boost. 

On the other hand, there are concerns for Liverpool, particularly regarding the adjustment period under new management and a lack of transfer activity. While some predict Liverpool will finish third, others believe they may struggle to challenge for the title. The general sentiment is that Man City remains the team to beat, with their consistency making them the likely champions again. Arsenal fans are excited about their prospects, hoping to close the gap to City and possibly secure their first title in years.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 12:00:13+0000
Liverpool journalist: Club “open to selling” Luis Diaz as exit rumours persist,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/liverpool-journalist-club-open-to-selling-luis-diaz-as-exit-rumours-persist/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Luis Diaz's future has come under scrutiny following rumors that he might join Manchester City, which were quickly dismissed by sources from both clubs. Despite the speculation, This Is Anfield reports that Liverpool has not received any formal approach for the winger. Journalist David Lynch suggests that while the club is not eager to sell Diaz, there is an openness to the idea, as they believe they could upgrade their options on the left side. Lynch notes that Diaz's capabilities are acknowledged, but Liverpool feels there are potential replacements available. Anthony Gordon is mentioned as a primary target, although Newcastle's current position complicates that possibility. The club reportedly values Diaz at £75 million, a figure that may deter Barcelona given their financial issues. Even though Liverpool is unlikely to pursue a new defensive midfielder this summer, they are not actively seeking offers for Diaz. His performance in pre-season, where he scored twice against Sevilla, highlights his potential impact for the upcoming season. As the transfer window nears its end, Diaz remains a player to watch closely.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 11:25:24+0000
‘Balancing chaos’ – Arne Slot tells fans what they can expect from Liverpool this season,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/balancing-chaos-arne-slot-tells-fans-what-they-can-expect-from-liverpool-this-season/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Arne Slot‘s style has similarities to what Jurgen Klopp brought with him to Liverpool, but the new head coach has outlined the differences fans will see from his team in 2024/25. The Reds’ season starts in three days, and there begins the spotlight that will follow Slot as he begins his first campaign at Anfield. In an interview with Canal+, Slot spoke of what fans can expect to see more of as the season unfolds and how he’s eager to balance the chaotic moments that Klopp and his team thrived on. The Dutchman explained: “Style of play has been with my teams where I worked, I think, always the same. There are a lot of similarities with Jurgen Klopp, with the way they played in the past, and I’m hoping we will see these similarities in the upcoming weeks and months. “We like to have the ball, we don’t like the other team to have the ball. But the Premier League is a league where many good clubs are and many clubs want to have the ball, so we have to fight really hard for us to have the ball. A critique, if you will, of Klopp’s game late on was how he harnessed the chaos and looked for it too often. Slot, on the other hand, wants to strike a balance, and as he previously coined it, “kill them with passes.”",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 10:10:34+0000
Who is Giorgi Mamardashvili? The 6’6″ goalkeeper Liverpool could now sign,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/who-is-giorgi-mamardashvili-liverpool-transfer-news-scouting/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Liverpool is reportedly looking to sign Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili this summer, with discussions already underway. The 23-year-old has been Valencia’s first-choice goalkeeper for the past two-and-a-half seasons, making 100 appearances since joining from Dinamo Tbilisi in 2021. Mamardashvili recently made headlines during the Euros, where he was instrumental in Georgia's surprising run to the last 16, showcasing his shot-stopping abilities and reflexes. Standing at 6'6"", he is dominant in his area and has been praised for his agility and quickness off his line. 

While Liverpool's interest in Mamardashvili is confirmed, the extent of the negotiations varies by source, with some suggesting a deal is close while others indicate the club is merely monitoring the situation. If he joins, he would initially serve as a backup to Alisson, who may be nearing the end of his time at Liverpool. The plan could involve loaning Mamardashvili out to gain experience before he potentially takes over as the first-choice goalkeeper. His leadership and communication skills are also noted as significant assets for any team.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 09:35:57+0000
Sepp van den Berg sees club drop transfer interest due to Liverpool’s “stubborn attitude”,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/sepp-van-den-berg-sees-club-drop-transfer-interest-due-to-liverpools-stubborn-attitude/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Sepp van den Berg has attracted significant transfer interest this summer, but Liverpool's high price tag has deterred potential suitors, leading one club to withdraw from the race. The centre-back has been a consistent presence in pre-season, although he missed the recent Anfield friendlies due to ""load management."" Reports indicate that at least 11 clubs are interested in Van den Berg, with PSV being a leading contender after submitting an £8.4 million bid, which Liverpool rejected, valuing him closer to £20 million. This valuation would set a transfer record for PSV, and due to Liverpool's firm stance, the Dutch club has decided to shift their focus elsewhere. Liverpool has not made a final decision on Van den Berg's future, and with multiple interested parties, they are under no pressure to lower their asking price. Other clubs such as Mainz, Stuttgart, and Bayer Leverkusen are also monitoring the situation. Van den Berg himself acknowledged the high valuation, stating that while it is a compliment, it complicates potential moves. With just over two weeks left in the transfer window, Liverpool has much work to do regarding player transfers.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 09:11:07+0000
Reporter claims Real Madrid “cooling their interest” in Trent Alexander-Arnold,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/reporter-claims-real-madrid-cooling-their-interest-in-trent-alexander-arnold/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. With Trent Alexander-Arnold yet to pen an extension at Liverpool, his future remains a focal point for fans, although his headline suitors have reportedly ‘cooled their interest’. Alexander-Arnold is one of three key players out of contract next summer, alongside Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah. Sporting director Richard Hughes prioritizes securing Alexander-Arnold's future, as losing him on a free transfer would be detrimental. Real Madrid has been linked to the 25-year-old, especially given his friendship with Jude Bellingham, but reports indicate that their interest is waning. 

While it’s reassuring that none of the trio are pushing for an exit, Van Dijk noted that there have been “no changes” to his contract situation. The players will assess the club's direction under the new head coach, which requires trust in the club's plans. Van Dijk expressed confidence that Liverpool will make the right decisions in the transfer market, emphasizing the need for signings to compete effectively. However, recent developments, such as Martin Zubimendi's decision to stay at his boyhood club, suggest that Liverpool may not sign a No. 6 this summer. Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, and Salah will undoubtedly be closely monitoring these situations.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 08:34:09+0000

We’re less than a week away from Liverpool returning to Premier League action, marking the start of the 23rd season of the This Is Anfield website. Arne Slot becomes the 22nd permanent manager in the club’s history, the seventh since This Is Anfield began in 2001.

8 new things in Premier League this season – big offside and team news changes,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/8-new-things-in-premier-league-this-season-big-offside-and-team-news-changes/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. The 2024/25 season is right around the corner, bringing significant changes for Liverpool and the Premier League. Arne Slot aims to build on the foundations left by his predecessor, with a focus on returning to the Champions League. Leicester and Southampton return to the top flight, joined by Ipswich Town, who are back in the Premier League for the first time in 22 years. The Reds will face Ipswich on the opening day and meet the other two promoted sides by Boxing Day.

The Premier League has approved the use of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT) for the new season, which will speed up offside decisions using limb-tracking technology. Starting lineups will now be confirmed 75 minutes before kickoff, aligning with UEFA practices. The new Nike Flight ball, featuring AerowSculpt technology, will be purple, yellow, and white, marking the 25th season with Nike as the official supplier.

Arne Slot is among several new managers in the Premier League, with others like Fabian Hurzeler and Enzo Maresca also taking charge for the first time. VAR will continue to be used, with a focus on improving its implementation. Notably, there will be no winter or mid-season break this season, allowing for a longer summer break for players.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-14 06:00:44+0000
"Arne Slot will have some leniency, but what’s possible for Liverpool in 2024/25?",https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/arne-slot-will-have-some-leniency-but-whats-possible-for-liverpool-in-2024-25/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Arne Slot knows he will be afforded a level of leniency in his first season at Liverpool, but he is aware of what a strong start can inspire. Just over ten years ago, Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool team finished their campaign with 12 wins from the last 14 games, but it wasn’t enough to secure the title. Slot would give anything to “be in the equation,” as Liverpool managed a strong start that season with three wins from the first three matches. The margin for error in the Premier League has decreased significantly since then, and missteps against lesser teams can be seismic. Slot understands that an awkward start will raise impatience levels, even during a honeymoon period. He noted that the last few percentages of improvement can make the difference between winning the title or finishing third. The Reds have learned that dropped points are costly, even if they finish strongly. To keep the title dream alive, they must capitalize on a favorable set of opening fixtures. Slot expressed confidence in his players and aims to exceed the points total necessary to compete with teams like Arsenal and City. The new manager bounce factor is crucial, and Slot's pre-season has gone well, setting the stage for a fast start.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-13 17:00:18+0000

Liverpool’s interest in Giorgi Mamardashvili appears to have strengthened, with several Spanish media outlets claiming that the club is “working at full speed” to sign the Valencia goalkeeper. A meeting has already been scheduled for Liverpool to discuss the deal, with the possibility of Mamardashvili being loaned out to ensure he remains a regular starter, which is reportedly appealing to him. Meanwhile, the referee for Liverpool’s Premier League opener has been confirmed, as the club prepares for the new season. 

Additionally, Liverpool has released official behind-the-scenes footage from their recent friendlies against Sevilla and Las Palmas. The excitement continues with the Carabao Cup match between Sheffield United and Wrexham, set to be broadcast live.

Liverpool left-back Owen Beck is expected to leave the club soon, with interest from at least seven clubs across four countries. He was notably absent from Liverpool’s final two pre-season friendlies against Sevilla and Las Palmas, which raises questions about his future. The 22-year-old has played three times for the first team and could leave on loan or permanently. Celtic and Rangers have shown interest, along with clubs in Germany and the Netherlands. Championship side QPR is reportedly leading the chase for a temporary deal, with Middlesbrough and Leeds also interested. Beck missed the recent friendlies due to illness but is expected to have his future resolved this week. Liverpool wants him to sign a new contract before going out on loan and values him at around £3 million. With Andy Robertson set to be the first-choice left-back, Beck would benefit from another short-term move. Last season, he spent time on loan at Dundee, where he scored two goals and provided four assists in 28 appearances.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-13 14:37:48+0000
Liverpool and Man City sources have now responded to bizarre Luis Diaz rumour,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/liverpool-and-man-city-sources-have-now-responded-to-bizarre-luis-diaz-rumour/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Less than half an hour after a bizarre rumour emerged from Spain over Luis Diaz joining Man City, sources from Liverpool and Manchester have now responded. Diaz’s future remains a hot topic in Spain and Colombia, including ongoing claims that he could join Barcelona as an alternative to Nico Williams. The winger returned to pre-season with Liverpool last week and made an outstanding start to life under Arne Slot with a brace in Sunday’s 4-1 friendly win over Sevilla. However, This Is Anfield understands that Liverpool have received no approach for the Colombia winger from any club. Tuesday brought a wild claim from journalist Marcos Benito, who told Spanish outlet El Chiringuito TV that Diaz had agreed to join Man City on a five-year deal. Further sources from both Liverpool and Man City have rejected the rumour, with The Athletic’s Sam Lee bringing word from the Etihad that there is “no truth” to Benito’s claim. Speaking while on international duty with Colombia in June, Diaz himself insisted he was “very happy” at Anfield. Diaz’s current contract runs to 2027, but it has been reported that Liverpool could seek to tie him down to improved terms amid interest from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. As it stands, then, the plan is for Diaz to head into the club’s first campaign under Slot as first choice on the left flank.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-13 12:29:41+0000
Referee and VAR confirmed for Ipswich vs. Liverpool in Premier League opener,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/referee-and-var-confirmed-for-ipswich-vs-liverpool-in-premier-league-opener/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Liverpool now know the team of officials in charge of their Premier League opener at Ipswich on Saturday, with Tim Robinson appointed as the referee. This will be Robinson’s fourth time officiating a Reds fixture, having previously refereed their Carabao Cup wins over Leicester and West Ham last season, as well as a league victory against Burnley. His assistants will be Timothy Wood and Steve Meredith, with Keith Stroud as the fourth official. Stuart Attwell will lead VAR duties, supported by Harry Lennard. 

Liverpool’s match at Portman Road will be the second fixture of the Premier League campaign, following Man United vs. Fulham on Friday night. This will be the first clash between Liverpool and Ipswich since December 2002, and their first league meeting since May 2002, which ended in a 5-0 win for Liverpool. A change in management for Liverpool could influence how they are officiated, as Jurgen Klopp has had notable run-ins with officials during his tenure. 

Robinson has not been involved in major controversies with Liverpool, having shown no red cards or awarded penalties in his previous matches. However, Attwell has faced criticism for his VAR decisions, notably during a 1-1 draw with Man City where he overlooked a potential penalty incident.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-13 12:08:06+0000
Liverpool “working at full speed” to sign Giorgi Mamardashvili – club sources respond,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2024/08/liverpool-working-at-full-speed-to-sign-giorgi-mamardashvili-club-sources-respond/,"This is an article by This is Anfield. Reports of Liverpool’s push to sign Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili have accelerated in Spain, though sources on Merseyside are less emphatic. Mamardashvili has emerged as a realistic target for the Reds this summer, with claims that they could sign the Georgian before loaning him out. It was reported that Liverpool were “determined to sign” the 23-year-old as a long-term replacement for Alisson, proposing to buy him for €30 million (£25.6m) before loaning him to Bournemouth. Spanish sources have intensified the story, with reports indicating that Liverpool are “working at full speed” to secure Mamardashvili. AS journalist Julian Burgos claims the Reds informed Valencia that a “final offer” would come within 72 hours. Liverpool intends to sign Mamardashvili and loan him to a Premier League club until 2025/26, with interest from four teams. However, league rules state that “Premier League clubs cannot loan to another Premier League club a player they have acquired in the same transfer window.” While reports suggest Liverpool are close to signing him, sources within the club insist they are simply “monitoring” Mamardashvili. The reluctance to confirm a deal hints at ongoing negotiations, with the club likely seeking a more favorable payment structure. If the deal were to go ahead, it would involve Valencia, Liverpool, and the club taking Mamardashvili on loan.",Liverpool FC,This is Anfield,2024-08-13 11:17:16+0000
Ten potential breakout stars to watch in the Premier League this season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/article/2024/aug/14/ten-potential-breakout-stars-to-watch-in-the-premier-league-this-season,"This is an article by The Guardian. The Swedish teenager Lucas Bergvall agreed an £8.5m move from Djurgården in February, before officially joining Tottenham this summer. Bergvall is an all-action midfielder, well suited to a No 8 role in Ange Postecoglou’s fluid Tottenham system. Another player who has staked their claim for more regular first-team involvement during pre-season is Manchester United’s Harry Amass. Though perhaps already a household name, Oscar Bobb looks to have a strong chance of making a real impact under Pep Guardiola. Viewed predominantly as a central midfielder throughout his time at the Arsenal Academy, Myles Lewis-Skelly may break into Mikel Arteta’s first team sooner rather than later. A versatile attacker who has now settled on the No 10 role as his best, Tyler Dibling is the latest player to emerge from Southampton’s renowned academy setup. The 17-year-old Liverpool midfielder Trey Nyoni could be the latest youngster to establish himself in the first team. Should he remain at the club, Chelsea attacker Marc Guiu could have a strong impact. The former Chelsea youngster Lewis Hall saw his loan move to Newcastle made permanent this summer. Yankuba Minteh made the move to Brighton for a reported £33m and is expected to play a big part under the new Brighton boss Fabian Hürzeler.",Football,The Guardian,2024-08-14 13:00:15+0000

A quieter time after plenty of off-field turmoil and making their way up the table are the main aims at the City Ground. The important thing at Forest is for the focus to be on the pitch rather than their social media channels or owner. Lessons are slowly being learned, and the scatter-gun recruitment has been replaced by something akin to strategy with deals being done early. A key problem last season was the whopping load of goals conceded from set pieces, prompting the signing of centre-back Nikola Milkenkovic and a 6ft 8in goalkeeper from Brazil. Nuno Espírito Santo has plenty of wingers to choose from, including the inexperienced but talented Jota Silva, who will support Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Striker Taiwo Awoniyi's fitness will be crucial for Forest's ambitions of a top-half finish. Efficient early business has been a welcome change, with Moussa Niakhaté sold to ease financial pressures. Forest's first three games are against Bournemouth, Wolves, and Southampton, and they hope to build a platform for a better campaign. Nuno faced a hard act in following the popular Steve Cooper but improved the team's defense and attack fluidity. Since their arrival in the Premier League, there has been plenty of chaos, but things are calmer now, with plans for stadium expansion and a focus on on-field performance.",Football,The Guardian,2024-08-14 11:00:12+0000
Women’s football at the Olympics is not working – it needs to change | Sophie Downey,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/14/womens-football-olympics-not-working,"This is an article by The Guardian. As dusk drew in on Paris on Saturday, the curtain closed on another Olympic tournament, marked by the USA players securing their fifth gold medal. The joy of the moment was palpable, but as celebrations fade, questions arise about the competition's place in the women's football ecosystem. The Olympics must adapt to retain its prestigious reputation while balancing the demands of major international tournaments with players' need for rest. The current format is grueling, with finalists playing six games in 17 days, leading to slow, low-energy matches. The pandemic has compounded these issues, resulting in a condensed calendar and extensive injury lists among players. Solutions such as increasing squad sizes and removing extra time could alleviate pressure, while an under-23 format might provide opportunities for younger talent. Additionally, the attractiveness of Olympic football is in question, with disappointing attendances and lengthy match days. The disparity in team numbers between the men's and women's tournaments further complicates global interest. The IOC's reluctance to change raises concerns about gender inequality and the future of the women's tournament. If the Olympics are to remain a key part of the football calendar, these issues must be addressed before 2028.",Football,The Guardian,2024-08-14 11:00:13+0000

In last season’s Eredivisie, De Klassieker had an aggregate score of Feyenoord 10-0 Ajax. Ajax faced the harsh reality of losing 4-0 at home and 6-0 away, leading to discussions about the worst derby defeats. Historically, Sunderland's 9-1 victory over Newcastle in 1909 remains one of the most lopsided results, with an aggregate score of 12-2 across both matches. In the Premier League era, notable defeats include Manchester United's 5-0 and 3-0 wins over City in 1994-95 and Liverpool's 5-0 and 4-0 victories over United in 2021-22. Bayern Munich also recorded a significant win against Borussia Dortmund, with an aggregate score of 12-1 in the 1971-72 season. 

Additionally, Ajax's recent match against Panathinaikos in the Europa League was a replay of the 1971 European Cup final, raising questions about the earliest repeats of major finals in UEFA competitions. The creativity of football fans in throwing objects onto the pitch has led to memorable incidents, including a live chicken thrown by Blackburn fans in protest against their owners. The first football club to have an official website was Ipswich Town, established in 1990, which sparked discussions about the evolution of club websites and social media presence. Lastly, questions about players taking sabbaticals and the most alphabetically lopsided leagues have emerged, showcasing the ongoing curiosity in football statistics and history.",Football,The Guardian,2024-08-14 07:00:35+0000

Conor Gallagher has returned to London after his proposed move from Chelsea to Atlético Madrid was put on hold, with the England midfielder expected to resume training with the club’s under-21 squad. Atlético had agreed a £34m fee for Gallagher, who has spent the past week in the Spanish capital after completing his medical. The collapse of Chelsea’s move for striker Samu Omorodion has left the deal in jeopardy, with Atlético needing to sell another player to finance their move for the 24-year-old England international. Gallagher has rejected a new contract offer from Chelsea and turned down a move to Aston Villa this summer. He must now wait to see if the deal with Atlético can be resurrected or whether any other clubs make a bid. There could be more departures in the coming weeks if Félix is signed, with forwards Raheem Sterling and Noni Madueke among those believed to be on the market. Chelsea are expected to hold further negotiations with Napoli over a potential loan move for Victor Osimhen, with optimism that a deal for both players can be agreed.

Manchester United confirm signings of Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/13/manchester-united-sign-mathijs-de-ligt-noussair-mazraoui,"This is an article by The Guardian. Manchester United have laid down an early marker for the season by completing the £60m double transfer deal of Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui from Bayern Munich. The United manager, Erik ten Hag, had made it clear to the board that he needed to reinforce his squad after last season was blighted by injuries. The double transfer boost comes on the day that Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s departure to West Ham for a £15m fee was confirmed. De Ligt, who has won league titles with Ajax, Juventus, and Bayern, expressed excitement about the opportunity at Manchester United, stating, “I felt an excitement about the opportunity of a new challenge at such a historic club.” He will strengthen United’s central defence following the departure of Raphaël Varane. Full-back Mazraoui, who also played under Ten Hag at Ajax, shared his enthusiasm, saying, “It’s an incredible feeling to be a United player, and I cannot wait to walk out at Old Trafford wearing the red shirt.” The new arrivals are set to be available for United’s season-opener against Fulham at Old Trafford on Friday night.

Premier League to bring in AI-powered camera system to speed up VAR process,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/13/premier-league-to-introduce-revolutionary-camera-system-to-aid-var-process,"This is an article by The Guardian. The Premier League is set to introduce a new version of the video assistant referee system using semi-automatic offside technology (SAOT), which aims to enhance officiating. Developed by Genius Sports, the AI-powered system will utilize 28 computer vision cameras at each Premier League ground, promising to deliver VAR verdicts within seconds and reduce match delays. Last season, lengthy VAR checks were a significant issue, with an average referral taking 64 seconds, extending game lengths to nearly 102 minutes. In response to fan frustrations, the Premier League's chief football officer, Tony Scholes, advocated for SAOT, which received unanimous support from clubs. Genius Sports outbid Hawk-Eye to secure the SAOT contract, and testing has shown that the system can reduce waiting times to around 30 seconds. The technology captures 10,000 data points for each player and the ball, allowing for precise offside decisions and the potential display of graphics in stadiums. The Premier League believes this system will provide the most sophisticated officiating in sports, with installation expected to occur after the international break. Hawk-Eye will continue to manage goalline technology for at least another season. The introduction of SAOT aims to prevent the high-profile offside errors that plagued the previous season.",Football,The Guardian,2024-08-13 20:19:51+0000

The Rangers head coach, Philippe Clement, called the dismissal of Jefté in the team’s Champions League defeat to Dynamo Kyiv “the worst decision I’ve seen in more than 30 years.” The Brazilian winger was booked in the first half and sent off in the 51st minute after what appeared to be a harsh second yellow card for an aerial challenge. With the tie poised at 1-1, Kyiv capitalized with late goals from Oleksandr Pikhalyonok and Nazar Voloshyn, winning 2-0 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate. Clement expressed his disappointment, stating, “This is the worst decision I have seen in more than 30 years of football.” 

In other matches, Red Bull Salzburg maintained control against FC Twente, advancing despite a late comeback from the hosts. José Mourinho’s Fenerbahce saw their hopes dashed by Lille, who secured a 3-2 aggregate victory after a penalty in extra time.

Sheffield United cut down Wrexham as Auston Trusty leads stirring fightback,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/13/sheffield-united-wrexham-championship-match-report,"This is an article by The Guardian. After a summer littered with upheaval and uncertainty at Bramall Lane, Chris Wilder could not have wished for a better opening five days to start life back in the Championship for Sheffield United. Wilder admitted that his squad was not where he would have wanted it to be going into the Championship opener against Preston, with sixteen senior players out and a takeover saga still unresolved. However, the early signs looked promising as United secured a deserved win over Preston and advanced comfortably in the Carabao Cup against Wrexham. Despite a sluggish start and falling behind, United rallied to win, with Wilder praising the team's attitude and discipline. 

In other matches, Charlie Adam's Fleetwood Town shocked West Brom with a 2-1 win, while Watford thrashed MK Dons 5-0. Several teams faced tough challenges, with Norwich narrowly defeating Stevenage 4-3 and QPR edging Cambridge 2-1. Wilder's squad is set to receive further reinforcements, with potential signings from Plymouth and Crystal Palace on the horizon.

Leah Williamson, the England captain and Arsenal defender, reflects on her journey in football while opening a new 3G pitch in her hometown of Newport Pagnell. She recalls how, at her age, there were no girls' teams available, contrasting her experience with the opportunities now available to young girls. The pitch is part of a £25m investment aimed at providing high-quality facilities for women and girls, responding to the increased interest in football following the Lionesses' Euro 2022 victory. Williamson emphasizes the importance of creating a welcoming environment for girls in sports, noting that they often have to step outside their social groups to pursue their passion. Robert Sullivan, chief executive of the Football Foundation, highlights the broader community benefits of such facilities, including public health and economic impacts. Looking ahead, Williamson is preparing for Champions League qualifiers and a competitive Women’s Super League match against Manchester City.

West Ham have signed Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Manchester United for a reported transfer fee of £15m. The 26-year-old defender, who made 190 appearances over five seasons for United after joining from Crystal Palace for £50m in 2019, has agreed a seven-year contract with the Hammers. “It’s an amazing feeling to be back in London and I’m excited for what’s coming,” he said.

Newcastle must pay ‘superstar money’ to sign Crystal Palace defender Guéhi,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/13/newcastle-united-crystal-palace-football-marc-guehi,"This is an article by The Guardian. Newcastle have been told they must pay “superstar money” to sign Marc Guéhi after Crystal Palace rejected a third bid for the England defender. The Palace chairman, Steve Parish, is evidently playing hardball with Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian majority owners, having rebuffed a latest offer understood to be in the region of £55m. “If you want a superstar player you’ve got to play superstar money,” Parish told Sky Sports. He emphasized that Guéhi is a player they value highly and that they are not in a position to make a decision on his future yet. Although Guéhi is believed to be keen to move to Newcastle, he is not openly agitating for a transfer. With the deal at an impasse, Newcastle’s manager Eddie Howe is contemplating starting the new season with limited options in central defense. Howe is still building a relationship with Newcastle’s new sporting director, Paul Mitchell, and their bond would be strengthened if Mitchell could secure Guéhi. If the Guéhi deal does not happen, Newcastle may attempt to recruit Milan center-half Malick Thiaw. Additionally, Howe is concerned about Fulham negotiating with Palace over central defender Joachim Andersen, which could impact Guéhi's potential move.

I reiterate that I will not remain silent in the face of prejudice. I will continue to live and share my life with authenticity and courage, in the hope that one day everyone will be free to love whoever they want, without fear of judgment or reprisal.

Martín Zubimendi declines Liverpool move as Brentford seal Carvalho deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/12/brentford-fabio-carvalho-completes-27m-move-from-liverpool,"This is an article by The Guardian. Liverpool have suffered a major blow in their attempts to strengthen Arne Slot’s midfield after Martín Zubimendi opted to stay at Real Sociedad. The Spain international was Liverpool’s preferred target for the defensive midfield role, but he informed Liverpool’s sporting director Richard Hughes that he has decided to remain with his boyhood club. Sociedad had made a concerted effort to keep Zubimendi, especially after selling defender Robin Le Normand to Atlético Madrid. They had told Zubimendi he would have to force a move to Anfield by paying his own €60m release clause, which Liverpool was prepared to activate. 

In other news, Fábio Carvalho has completed his move from Liverpool to Brentford for a fee that could rise to £27.5m. The attacking midfielder attracted interest from several Premier League clubs, but only Brentford met Liverpool’s valuation. Carvalho spent last season on loan at RB Leipzig and Hull, struggling for regular playing time under former manager Jürgen Klopp. Brentford’s head coach, Thomas Frank, praised Carvalho's qualities and versatility, noting his ability to create chances and work hard under pressure.

The British Olympic Association (BOA) wants a Great Britain men’s football team competing at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. Andy Anson, the BOA chief executive, expressed his strong desire for this to happen, and it is understood that the Football Association is also keen. However, convincing the football associations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland will require significant diplomatic efforts due to their historical opposition to a unified men’s team at the Olympics. They have long maintained that their independence in Fifa and Uefa tournaments could be jeopardized by competing as a single team. Despite this, there have been no negative consequences since the Team GB men’s and women’s teams participated in London 2012 or since a women’s team with players from England, Wales, and Scotland competed at Tokyo 2020. Anson emphasized the potential benefits for football and youth football, stating, “Seeing the women’s team compete is brilliant and I would love to see the men’s team compete in the same way.” He also noted that Team GB would benefit from new sports at the LA Games, highlighting the success of the women’s teams in various sports.

Erik ten Hag’s future was uncertain after Manchester United's lowest-ever finish, but he now has the backing of Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Both men acknowledge that time is needed for the club to return to glory, especially after finishing eighth last season. However, they may see themselves as dark horse contenders in the championship race due to their winning mentality. Despite injuries to new signings Leny Yoro and Rasmus Højlund, Ten Hag could have a stronger squad by the end of the transfer market, with potential upgrades in key positions. The left-back situation remains a concern, but there is hope for young talent Harry Amass to emerge. Ten Hag's new two-year contract reflects Ratcliffe's confidence in him, although players may question his stability after his near dismissal. The relationship between Ineos and Ten Hag will be crucial moving forward, especially if the team struggles early in the season. Last season, Ten Hag developed homegrown talents like Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, and this year he hopes to nurture Amass and Amad Diallo. Bruno Fernandes's future is uncertain, as he may be seeking a pay rise or a transfer, which complicates Ten Hag's plans.

Key players are ageing but a record fifth consecutive title under Pep Guardiola still seems within reach. Last season’s position: 1st. Predicting that Manchester City will retain the title has become a near-gimme of an exercise. The common sense answer regarding whether last season’s four-peat can become a five-peat is “yes,” as Guardiola’s team has shown resilience in contention. However, there is a discernible end-of-days feel about this Guardiola iteration, with key players like Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker ageing and the manager entering the final year of his contract. Despite this, Phil Foden emerged as a key player last season, scoring 19 league goals. Guardiola has a penchant for freshening up his squad, but so far, they have only signed Savinho from Troyes. The upcoming financial charges against City could weigh heavily on the team, potentially affecting their early form. Guardiola's love for the game and his players' commitment remain crucial, as does the question of how he will accommodate both Foden and De Bruyne in the lineup.

Amid a club overhaul, Arne Slot has made a good early impression as he looks to fine-tune a rich Anfield inheritance. Liverpool have lost a manager who was worshipped by the Kop, and the club now hopes Slot proves a replacement more in the mould of Bob Paisley than Graeme Souness. The former Feyenoord coach emerged as a leading candidate after a meticulous recruitment process overseen by the new sporting director, Richard Hughes. Slot’s rich inheritance also includes the return of Champions League football after a one-year absence, and he is expected to keep the club there. His hands-on approach to training and more possession-based tactics have been welcomed in pre-season, particularly by Liverpool’s midfielders. However, it is far from ideal that Slot has started work in a summer of a European Championship and a Copa América, limiting his time with the full squad. Slot admitted he had “big shoes to fill” after Klopp’s departure, but he aims to make his mark in winning and developing the team. He promises an evolution of Liverpool’s style rather than radical change, having identified Real Sociedad’s Martín Zubimendi for a defensive midfield upgrade.

Steve Cooper is a shrewd appointment as manager, but problems related to profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) may complicate Leicester's return to the top tier. Last season, they won the Championship, but the departure of star player Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and manager Enzo Maresca to Chelsea has left them in a challenging position. An alleged PSR breach could lead to a points deduction, making survival in the Premier League even more difficult. Cooper's management style differs from Maresca's, focusing on counterattacking rather than possession control, and the squad has responded positively to his methods during pre-season. The transfer activity has been limited, with only a few signings, including experienced players like Bobby De Cordova-Reid and Conor Coady, who will play a crucial role in the relegation battle. Despite losing Dewsbury-Hall, Leicester retains quality from their recent campaigns, with Harry Winks expected to step up in midfield. Cooper's reputation for developing young talent could be beneficial, especially with players like Abdul Fatawu, who has made his loan permanent. The club faces challenges with fan dissatisfaction over ticket prices and streaming charges, and they will need strong performances to regain support. As Cooper navigates these issues, his ability to maintain player confidence will be vital for Leicester's success in the Premier League.",Football,The Guardian,2024-08-11 23:01:25+0000

In the winter of 1986, Ipswich Town faced Liverpool at Portman Road, a match that would become a memorable upset. At that time, Ipswich was struggling in the relegation zone, while Liverpool was in a fierce title race. The match began with Liverpool taking the lead through Ronnie Whelan's header from a free-kick. However, Ipswich turned the tide in the second half, equalizing with a goal from Mich D’Avray after a mistake by Liverpool's goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar. 

Ipswich's tactical changes, including the introduction of young forward Michael Cole, proved effective as they began to dominate the game. Kevin Wilson scored the winning goal for Ipswich, sealing a 2-1 victory and marking a significant moment for the club. Liverpool's manager, Kenny Dalglish, acknowledged his team's poor performance, stating they got ""what we deserved – nothing."" Despite the win, Ipswich would ultimately face relegation that season, while Liverpool managed to recover and finish the season with a double.

Norwich City announced the departure of Delia Smith, marking the end of an era for both the club and English football. The announcement was made online, focusing on financial details rather than the personal contributions of Smith and her husband, Michael Wynn-Jones. Smith's 27-year tenure included significant achievements, such as six promotions and memorable victories, but she faced constant criticism from supporters regarding financial decisions and managerial choices. Despite her ambitions for the club to be sustainable and community-focused, many fans perceived a lack of ambition. One of the most infamous moments of her time came during a 2005 match against Manchester City, where her plea for fan support became a point of ridicule. Smith's desire for a passionate home atmosphere was never fully realized, and her comments about the crowd's negativity did not help her standing with fans. As she passes ownership to American Mark Attanasio, there is a sense that the club will now be part of a larger portfolio of investments, potentially losing its community-centric ethos.

The loss and loneliness of the unemployed football manager,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/12/loss-loneliness-unemployed-football-manager,"This is an article by The Guardian. The plight of the unemployed manager is a curious phenomenon, one that lurches from loss to loneliness and often a long, hopeless struggle to get back in. It usually begins with a sacking, as experienced by Mark McGhee, who recalls the emotional turmoil of being dismissed after a series of poor results. The transition from being deeply involved in football to the mundane reality of daily life can be jarring, leading to feelings of sadness and isolation. Managers lower down the hierarchy face additional pressures, as they often lack financial security and must support their families. The mental toll can be severe, with many likening the experience to a soldier being discharged, facing a sudden loss of purpose and camaraderie. 

Alan Pardew describes the rehabilitation phase for managers as comprising three stages: a break from football, honest reflection, and the challenging comeback. Networking and self-promotion become crucial, yet many managers struggle with these aspects, often relying on connections rather than solely on their skills. The job hunt can be unseemly, with agents working behind the scenes to promote their clients, often while current managers are still in their roles.

Chelsea’s pervasive chaos threatens to destabilize another season | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/12/chelsea-pre-season-enzo-maresca,"This is an article by The Guardian. Worrying pre-season results and ill-conceived recruitment leave manager Enzo Maresca with a series of headaches before the new campaign. Enzo Maresca’s record as Chelsea manager at this stage reads: played six, won one. That win came against the Mexican champions Club América, who currently sit in ninth place in their league. Chelsea have faced the champions of England, Spain, Scotland, and Italy in their warm-up matches, resulting in a challenging run of games. There’s also a pervading sense of chaos, as the club has spent £1bn on 28 senior players since the Clearlake takeover, yet continues to sign more players, including Pedro Neto for £51m. This raises questions about the performance of existing wide forwards like Raheem Sterling and Mykhailo Mudryk. The club's strategy seems focused on investing in youth, but with profit and sustainability regulations looming, trading will be essential. Selling academy products has generated significant funds, but concerns about the long-term viability of this approach remain. Despite some positives, the constant noise and disruption at Chelsea may hinder any manager's ability to establish a coherent playing style.",Football,The Guardian,2024-08-12 15:08:36+0000

Twelve years ago, Emma Hayes watched the USA women’s team win their fourth Olympic gold medal alongside her father, Sid. After being sacked by the Chicago Red Stars, she expressed to him her connection to the players on the field, a moment that highlighted her coaching prowess.

The emotional weight of loss was echoed by players like Fran Kirby, who articulated the struggle of celebrating success without loved ones present. Hayes's coaching philosophy emphasizes enjoyment and individual development, which she successfully instilled in the team.

England came from behind to win three knockout games at Euro 2024, raising the question of whether they are the first team to achieve this in a major international tournament. Spain eventually defeated England, but for a brief moment, it seemed England might win after conceding the first goal in all four knockout matches. Historical comparisons reveal that Croatia also came from behind to win three knockout games in the 2018 World Cup, while China achieved this feat at the AFC Women’s Asian Cup in 2022. South Korea showcased resilience in the 2023 AFC Men’s Asian Cup, coming back in multiple matches, although they ultimately lost in the semi-finals. Uruguay's iconic comeback in the 1950 World Cup, known as the Maracanazo, is another notable example of a team overcoming adversity.

There will be no home gold medal for France’s footballers at Paris 2024. Instead, it was Spain who ended up 5-3 winners of an astonishing men’s final after Sergio Camello scored twice in extra time at the Parc des Princes.

A source close to the discussions at beIN Sports and PSG denied any such request was made.

One man, wearing a white 1996-97 away shirt, expressed how he felt the riots “misrepresented the city and the club.” The relationship between the city and its football club has become two-way, as the city is now as much a projection of the club as the club is of the city.

When he was CEO at Motherwell, Pat Nevin had three future Premier League managers in his team: Owen Coyle, Billy Davies, and Roberto Martínez. The Sampdoria squad of 1985-86 had four future Premier League managers: Trevor Francis, Graeme Souness, Gianluca Vialli, and Roberto Mancini. Crystal Palace had the same number at the start of the 1994-95 season: Gareth Southgate, Iain Dowie, Chris Coleman, and Ray Wilkins. The Liverpool squad that won a treble in 1983-84 had five future managers: Souness, Kenny Dalglish, Phil Neal, Phil Thompson, and Sammy Lee. Ruud Gullit’s Chelsea squad of 1997-98 included six future managers, including Gianluca Vialli, who succeeded Gullit.

Erling Haaland voted the world’s best player – and he’s just getting started | Niall McVeigh,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/22/erling-haaland-manchester-city-top-100-analysis,"This is an article by The Guardian. The Norwegian is only 23 but his devastating goal record has seen him voted as the No 1 player in the world by the Guardian’s expert panel. When Pep Guardiola tearfully claimed Manchester City could not replace the departing Sergio Agüero in May 2021, he was soft-launching a global audition for his team’s new attacking talisman. An unsuccessful pursuit of Harry Kane in the summer of 2021 came between two title-winning seasons where Ilkay Gündogan and Kevin De Bruyne were the club’s top league goalscorers. Guardiola’s slick creative machine needed a new front man, and they found him in Erling Haaland. Like Agüero before him, Haaland arrived as a bona fide superstar, a plug-and-play addition to an already stellar lineup. Haaland went on to score 36 times in 35 league appearances in his debut season – a Premier League record. The goals often came in giddying bursts, and he successfully assimilated into a team stacked with creative talent. In the Champions League, Haaland stretched himself even further as City claimed that elusive European trophy, scoring five goals in a single match against Leipzig. Despite his domestic scoring exploits, he was still a crucial presence in the Champions League, contributing to key goals as City progressed. Haaland ended his first season with 52 goals, including 36 in the Premier League, breaking a record that was untouched since 1995.",Football,The Guardian,2023-12-22 17:30:01+0000

A summer transfer target for each Premier League club: part one,https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/article/2024/aug/07/summer-transfer-target-each-premier-league-club-ipswich-arsenal,"This is an article by The Guardian. With David Raya making his loan from Brentford permanent, Riccardo Calafiori joining from Bologna, and Mikel Merino expected to arrive from Real Sociedad, Arsenal should now focus on strengthening their frontline. They have been linked with Pedro Neto and Nico Williams, but targeting Leroy Sané would be more beneficial. Mikel Arteta's previous experience with Sané at Manchester City and the German's versatility would appeal to the Arsenal manager. Aston Villa, facing the departure of Moussa Diaby, needs a player who can operate both up front and behind Ollie Watkins, making Joao Felix a potential target. Bournemouth may seek another striker due to Dominic Solanke's uncertain future, with Cameron Archer fitting the bill. Brentford, after Igor Thiago's injury, might consider a short-term move for Arthur Cabral, who could benefit from more playing time. Brighton is looking for a left-back to replace the injured Pervis Estupinan, with Ferdi Kadioglu on their radar. Chelsea may pursue Samu Omorodion following Conor Gallagher's move to Atlético Madrid, as he could address their striker issues. Crystal Palace might need to replace Marc Guehi if he transfers to Newcastle, with Maxence Lacroix as a smart option.

Unfurl the bunting! Prepare the open-topped bus! Paint the city blue! Or perhaps not. This time it was City who won the second Manchester derby at Wembley inside 80 days, and while the Community Shield hardly competes with May’s FA Cup final, it does mean that a potential quintuple is on. City didn’t seem overjoyed at the final whistle, and United didn’t seem devastated. Having lost in each of the last three Community Shields, City know how little bearing the curtain-raiser has on the show to come. Four weeks after England’s defeat by Spain in the final of Euro 2024, English football returned with a sense of spiky reluctance. If United’s lineup looked a little more like the sort of team they would be expected to pick for a serious game, that was only because injuries and inept squad-building have led to unbalanced XIs.

If you want a child to make this list, you better make sure he is born as soon as possible after 1 September. Last month, the Guardian released Next Generation 2022: 20 of the best talents at Premier League clubs, selecting the best youngsters born between 1 September 2005 and 31 August 2006. Thirteen were born in the first semester of the selection year and seven in the second, indicating a significant skew towards the first half of the year. Over nine seasons, 136 out of 180 players were born in the first semester, highlighting the “relative age effect” in sports. This phenomenon suggests that cut-off dates for eligibility can impact performance, as those born just after the cut-off tend to be older and more mature. In youth sports, players born earlier in the eligibility year often exhibit advantages in strength, coordination, and decision-making skills. Despite the documented bias, clubs continue to overlook this issue, possibly due to a focus on immediate results rather than long-term development. Addressing the relative age effect could lead to significant savings and opportunities for clubs. The persistence of this bias raises questions about the awareness of scouts and recruitment staff regarding their selection processes.",Football,The Guardian,2022-10-24 07:00:01+0000

Exclusive: Can McLaren's culture survive two number one drivers?,https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/exclusive-can-mclarens-culture-survive-two-number-one-drivers/10643870/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RSS-F1&utm_term=News&utm_content=uk,"This is an article by Autosport. Formula 1's modern era is littered with examples of front-running teams paying a big price for sticking with two equal drivers. As recently as 2007, when McLaren fielded then-reigning world champion Fernando Alonso and rookie Lewis Hamilton, infighting saw both drivers miss out on the title by a single point as Kimi Raikkonen snatched the crown with Ferrari. Other notorious rivalries such as Senna/Prost, Hamilton/Rosberg, and Webber/Vettel had less of an impact on the end result, but still led to destabilization within the teams. McLaren CEO Zak Brown believes that the situation will be different with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who have both clinched their maiden grand prix wins before the 2024 summer break. Norris expressed regret for not returning the lead to Piastri earlier during a race, highlighting potential future tensions if McLaren continues to secure 1-2 finishes. Brown is confident that McLaren's team culture is strong enough to handle the competition between the two drivers. He emphasized the importance of relationships and communication, stating that both drivers are treated equally and respect the team's decisions. While he acknowledged that strategic decisions may change later in the championship, he believes that both drivers can race hard while still supporting the team. Brown also noted that team culture develops organically, and he and team principal Andrea Stella aim to foster a fair and competitive environment.",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-13 08:07:57+0000

Charles Leclerc believes Ferrari has made genuine progress with updates to its 2024 Formula 1 car, although the side-effect of bouncing has severely masked the improvements to the SF-24. When Ferrari introduced a new floor at the Spanish Grand Prix, it exacerbated an already-present level of bouncing, particularly in higher-speed corners, leading to unpredictability. To address this, Ferrari reverted to the Imola-spec floor for the British Grand Prix and later introduced a revised underbody for Hungary and Belgium. Leclerc noted that while the aero upgrades produced expected numbers, the bouncing issues hindered the team's performance. He explained that he had to adopt a more aggressive setup in recent races to find solutions, which ultimately affected performance. Leclerc emphasized that the bouncing created inconsistencies, making it difficult to push the car to its limits. He drew parallels to Ferrari's approach last season, where they prioritized learning over immediate results, leading to breakthroughs later on. Despite losing more races this year, he believes the team has gained a deeper understanding of their challenges. Leclerc remains confident that the lessons learned will benefit Ferrari moving forward.",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-12 14:47:08+0000

Esteban Ocon has lamented the lack of communication at the Alpine Formula 1 team and says he will do his utmost ""to not miss any single detail"" at Haas. The Frenchman has spent the last four and a half seasons with the Enstone-based outfit, whose performance over that period stagnated then deteriorated. With Alpine deciding to part ways for next season, Ocon will make the switch to Haas. His time at Alpine was marked by instability, especially at the management level, with the departures of 12 team leaders. Ocon is particularly aggravated by a lack of communication within the squad, which he sees as the main cause of its current downfall. He expressed that he has no regrets about leaving Alpine, stating he gave everything to the team. Ocon emphasized the importance of feedback loops between drivers and the team, which he feels were not properly established.

Red Bull put an end to weeks of speculation by backing Sergio Perez after the Belgian Grand Prix, confirming that Max Verstappen's struggling teammate will remain in his seat after the summer break. Perez has been struggling to perform in the RB20 since May, costing the team valuable points in the title fight. Despite the option to replace him after collecting just 28 points since May's Imola race, Red Bull has decided to support him instead. Red Bull technical director Pierre Wache indicated that further upgrades to the 2024 car will aim to enhance performance for both drivers. He acknowledged that Perez struggles more than Verstappen when the cars become difficult to operate, which is a significant factor in his performance issues. Wache noted that reproducing the car's handling traits in simulations is challenging, complicating their understanding of Perez's difficulties. The current era of low-slung cars presents risks with performance upgrades potentially making the cars harder to balance, affecting Perez's confidence more than Verstappen's.

Following its first Hollywood tie-up with the blockbuster Twisters, Red Bull's sister team RB aims to blend sport and entertainment, aspiring to democratize access to the series. The team's name change from AlphaTauri to RB has sparked controversy due to its similarity to the main team, despite efforts to establish a distinct identity. Red Bull, known for its extravagant PR stunts since joining F1 in 2005, is now seeing its sister team embrace this legacy, particularly with the popularity of drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Yuki Tsunoda among younger fans. CEO Peter Bayer announced plans to merge F1 with off-track entertainment, including a car wash event in Miami and a partnership with Warner Bros. for Twisters. Bayer emphasizes the importance of engaging a younger demographic, particularly young female fans, who are increasingly interested in F1. He notes that the team's balanced fan base and youthful audience make it attractive for sponsors and Hollywood collaborations. Bayer believes that RB's fresh approach allows for more freedom in partnerships compared to the main Red Bull team. The initiatives taken by RB have garnered positive attention from F1's leadership, aligning with Liberty Media's vision for the sport's growth.

Ayao Komatsu says Haas is currently enacting a recruitment drive “never seen before” in its Formula 1 history, after convincing owner Gene Haas and his key lieutenant to make fresh investment. Komatsu was appointed team principal of the American squad at the start of 2024, after Gene Haas opted to axe former team boss Guenther Steiner in a surprising move. This was after Haas had finished last in the 2023 constructors’ championship, and its owner did not want to provide more capital until the team had shown it could improve with what it already had. Komatsu, however, always insisted that Haas should be able to do exactly this, and with its VF-24 challenger, the team has gone on to already score 56% more than its points haul in 2023, with 10 races left in the current campaign. As a result, the ex-Lotus chief engineer approached his bosses about starting a new recruitment drive after the 2024 Australian GP, where Haas had scored its first double points finish since the 2022 Austrian GP. Haas plans to grow its team staff size, which is currently around 300 people, by approximately 10%. Komatsu emphasized the importance of showing improvement in performance to gain the owner's support for the recruitment drive. He also credited the positive atmosphere within the team and the impact of bringing Haas Automation CEO Bob Murray to the team. Next year, Haas will get a new motorhome for the first time in its F1 history, which the team feels is important for increasing squad morale and improving facilities for guests and sponsors. Komatsu's strategy focuses on aligning the owner's expectations with the realities of achieving success in Formula 1.",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-11 08:21:26+0000

Pierre Gasly says he understands and supports Alpine's decision to completely revamp its F1 car concept this year despite a disappointing campaign so far. Before undergoing a major technical reshuffle in recent months, Alpine chose not to develop the main ideas of the A523 any further in an attempt to open up a new avenue offering greater scope for development with this year's A524. Fourth in the constructors' championship in 2022, the Enstone-based team slipped to sixth place last year. But after the first half of the season, the results have left Alpine with only 11 points scored and in a very distant eighth place in the championship. Gasly continues to believe that the decision taken at the time was justified. ""I think it's performance-related. Last year the team felt that it got to the end of the development with their car concept,"" Gasly told Autosport. ""As we missed our targets, they're like, 'do we want to go for another year where we know we'll probably be stuck to where we are?' And they said, we want more than that, so, we'll try something else."" However, Gasly is counting on the work done at Enstone and on the margin for improvement to do better in the months to come and, above all, to have a more solid base when it comes to 2025. ""Unfortunately, it didn't pay out with the directions that you know they took with the car concept we have this year, but nonetheless, I still think the way the team's operating is at a better level than when I arrived,"" he said.",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-10 13:10:11+0000

Fans and journalists love to assess drivers, discover who is starring, who is underperforming, and how team-mates with the same machinery compare. With Formula 1 in its summer break, now seems like a good time to look at the crop of 2024. There are, of course, plenty of ways to compare drivers, but one of the key ones is raw speed. Below you can see how the 2024 F1 team-mates stack up after 14 rounds, based on their qualifying performances for grands prix. Although a fine gauge of assessing who is getting the upper hand in the intra-team fights, this metric is rather crude. To get a clearer view of the drivers’ actual speed, we’ve looked at supertimes, which can paint a much clearer picture of team-mate comparisons. The first thing to note is how remarkably close Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon are. The gap between George Russell and Hamilton at Mercedes is also small, suggesting Hamilton's performances have not dipped significantly. The Ferrari pairing can be viewed in one of two ways, either as a fine effort by Sainz or impressive for Leclerc to maintain his lead.

The next F1 race is the Dutch Grand Prix at the Circuit Zandvoort, marking the start of the second half of the year. The race will take place between 23-25 August, with Sunday’s race starting at 2pm BST. Pirelli announced that the tyre compounds available for the Dutch GP will be three of the hardest in their catalogue due to the hotter and more abrasive track.

Mick Schumacher's demeanour changes the moment I pick up on one of his answers to my question. I asked him how he likes to spend his free time and among the usual responses of being in the gym and cycling, there was one extracurricular activity that caught my attention. “I also like skydiving,” he says rather casually as we chat during the Canadian Grand Prix. The former Haas driver, who remains hopeful of returning to Formula 1, tells Autosport excitedly about his hobby: “My first skydive, if I remember right, I was eight or nine years old. It was obviously a tandem jump. Basically going up, I did not really like it so much, and then my sister did it and I was like 'damn, if my sister could do it, now I have to do it'. 

Schumacher says his adrenaline-fuelled pastime, which is also enjoyed by Lewis Hamilton and the two have skydived together, also allows him to improve his training as a racing driver. He explains: “It is not only an opportunity for me to get to know my body better... it helps to emphasise it time and again, especially when you have no security around you like in a race car. After a frustrating stint at Haas, Schumacher now finds himself as a reserve driver for Mercedes and competing in the World Endurance Championship with Alpine. He hopes that his time with Alpine and working with Mercedes will allow him to find a route to return to F1 after just two seasons at the back of the grid with Haas. 

Citing that he has a lot still to prove and a desire to silence his critics, he added: “Working with Alpine is an opportunity for a team on the F1 grid to get to know me better. I will continue trying until I succeed and I don't see any reason to give up. My focus is to get back to F1, that has been my dream since childhood and I will not give up on it.”",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-09 11:00:15+0000

Antonelli had long been earmarked as Hamilton's successor, but the Briton's shock departure to Ferrari caught Mercedes chief Toto Wolff by surprise and has meant the squad accelerated the Italian's development programme.

Although he was quickest in qualifying for the Belgian GP, a 10-place grid penalty due to an engine change put him out of contention, and he crossed the line in fifth, later classified fourth due to George Russell’s disqualification. Despite this, Verstappen still leads the championship by 78 points, having won seven of the opening 10 grands prix.

Keke Rosberg clinched the 1982 F1 world championship with only one grand prix win, going the first 13 races without a victory. Nelson Piquet experienced a similar drought in 1983, winning only after an 11-race winless streak. Jenson Button's 2009 championship win is notable as he won six of the first seven races but failed to win any of the last ten. Sebastian Vettel had a nine-race winless run in 2012 but still managed to clinch the title. Emerson Fittipaldi won the 1974 championship despite not winning the middle eight rounds, while Niki Lauda and Alain Prost both went seven races without a victory during their championship-winning years.",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-08 13:29:24+0000

The sporting element of Formula 1 remains important to boss Stefano Domenicali, even amidst criticisms of certain formats like sprint races. While resistance to the Saturday sprint format has diminished, Domenicali believes it works and is open to having up to eight sprints per year, potentially with a different grid setup. He acknowledges the initial criticism from purists but feels the changes introduced this year have improved the flow of the races. Domenicali also supports the idea of reverse grids, arguing that it creates more action and overtaking opportunities. He emphasizes the need for every session during a grand prix weekend to have a competitive element, questioning the value of practice sessions that do not contribute to the racing spectacle. 

Domenicali notes the shift towards more street circuits in the F1 calendar, asserting that while there are more city races, balance is crucial to ensure good racing. He reflects on the success of Netflix's ""Drive to Survive"" in attracting new fans and anticipates that an upcoming F1 movie will further elevate the sport's profile. He believes the film will showcase the complexities of F1 while maintaining the integrity of live racing. As he continues his tenure, Domenicali feels proud of the growth and direction of F1, though he acknowledges ongoing challenges, particularly related to climate change and the political environment.",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-08 07:36:29+0000

Ocon faced criticism from then-team principal Bruno Famin and was announced to be leaving Alpine at the end of the season, with Haas confirmed as his next team. He was even threatened with suspension for the Canadian GP, although that punishment did not materialize. Ocon expressed gratitude for the support he received, particularly from Williams team principal James Vowles, who reached out to him after the incident. He acknowledged the excessive noise on social media surrounding the clash, noting that it was important for him to raise his voice in response.

Helmut Marko has insisted Sergio Perez is still the best option to finish the Formula 1 season alongside Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen. Perez's slump in performance has allowed McLaren to narrow the gap to Red Bull in the constructors' standings, prompting Red Bull to reconsider whether to replace him. However, after evaluating their options, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner and Marko decided to continue supporting Perez, who recently signed a two-year contract extension. Marko stated that Perez just needs to find more consistency, highlighting his good performances, particularly in the Belgian Grand Prix qualifying. 

Marko emphasized that Perez will remain in the Red Bull car after the summer break, as the upcoming races are on tracks where he performed well last year. He refuted speculation that F1 owner Liberty Media influenced their driver choice, clarifying that while they want Perez to race in Mexico, their decision is not based on Liberty's intentions. Additionally, Marko addressed the future of reserve driver Liam Lawson, stating he would not be loaned to rival teams and that an announcement regarding Lawson's situation would come in September.

If the 2024 season has taught F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali one key lesson, it is that it is impossible to predict how things are going to turn out. While many were talking back in March of Max Verstappen potentially winning all the races this year after his dominant start in Bahrain, it did not turn out that way at all. In fact, with seven different winners from the first half of the season, the stage is set for a wide-open battle for victories after the summer break. Domenicali has always been open-minded about things; aware that what is viewed right today may not be true for tomorrow. Speaking in a wide-ranging interview, he explains why he thinks there is a great opportunity now for grand prix racing to continue riding the wave of popularity that erupted following the Liberty Media takeover. He acknowledges the concerns regarding the potential downside of new 2026 regulations, emphasizing that the best way to close the grid up is to keep the rules the same. Domenicali believes that the motivations behind the decision to change regulations are crucial, particularly in attracting new manufacturer interest. He also thinks that the weight of the cars is an issue that needs to be addressed in the future. The quest for lighter cars is something that was aimed for with the 2026 rules revamp, but efforts to reduce mass did not go as far as originally hoped.

Ricciardo has first-hand experience of Red Bull's pressure cooker alongside Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen. After two years flailing alongside Lando Norris at McLaren, Ricciardo faced the existential question of whether he had the stomach to return to F1. But return he did, after a test at Silverstone convinced Christian Horner that the old Honey Badger was still in there. Ricciardo started afresh in 2024, but found it harder to hit his stride as his teammate Yuki Tsunoda excelled. A chassis change in Shanghai proved a turning point, allowing Ricciardo to show more consistency. “To still have the speed, that's been really critical,” he says, reflecting on his journey.

The facility features state-of-the-art assembly areas and testing rigs, with strict compliance to F1 testing rules. Red Bull Powertrains aims to supply engines to four F1 teams, although their current focus remains on Red Bull Racing and the RB team. Horner emphasized the importance of integrating engine and chassis development on the same campus, a unique position among F1 teams.

His early-season struggles led to suggestions that he could be replaced, but Ricciardo's improvement has kept him in the frame for a potential seat at Red Bull.

Aston Martin team principal Mike Krack says there is “huge pressure” inside the squad to revive its Formula 1 results but claims owner Lawrence Stroll understands this will take time. This year, the team could not repeat its 2022-2023 off-season gains, where it rose from finishing seventh in the 2022 constructors’ championship to scoring six podiums in the first eight races. Although Aston’s year-on-year gains were impressive last season, rivals Ferrari and Mercedes improved significantly, which meant the green team’s glittering results dried up. This term, its major front wing, floor, and rear aero parts Imola upgrade package backfired, and while Aston has since made alterations, it currently sits fifth in this year’s constructors’ standings. Krack discussed how early 2023 was “flattering and probably not a true reflection of where we really were as a team.” He noted that while there are ambitious targets, it is unrealistic to expect to go from seventh to first quickly. The pressure is increasing as upgrades fail to deliver expected performance, and Krack acknowledges that there is less patience in the team.

Williams is planning a three-pronged upgrade to help get its 2024 Formula 1 season back on track, but has otherwise started focusing on 2025. The Grove-based team has taken a step backwards in 2024 after trying to design a car that is more competitive on various circuits, compared to 2023's one-trick pony that excelled on low-downforce tracks. While the 2023 car allowed Alex Albon to shine and take a decent haul of points, 2024's FW46 isn't competitive anywhere, being overhauled in the midfield by teams like RB and Haas. Williams heads into the summer break on four points, just ahead of a scoreless Sauber squad. Team boss James Vowles explained that Williams will target three areas of improvement with updates coming shortly after the summer break, focusing on aerodynamics, suspension design, and reducing weight. Vowles expressed hope that these updates would help the team fight for points again. He also mentioned that while new parts are in production, the design team has already shifted focus to 2025, aiming to get the 2026 car into the wind tunnel as soon as possible.

Red Bull Formula 1 technical director Pierre Wache says the team's RB20 ""didn’t deliver what we expected"" in every area. Red Bull won all but one race in 2023, and rather than rest on its laurels, the Milton Keynes-based squad made significant changes for this year's RB20 to ensure it would remain out front in F1. While it started the season strong with three 1-2 victories over the first four grands prix, it was gradually reeled in by rival teams, particularly McLaren and Mercedes. Wache noted that the team was expecting its 2024 car to be stronger in certain areas, especially in high-speed corners, based on simulation data. He admitted, ""I would say not really. We improved compared to last year, without doubt, but we didn’t deliver what we expected in some areas."" He highlighted that while improvements were made in medium-speed and low-speed corners, the team was weaker in high-speed corners relative to the competition. Wache attributed some of the discrepancies to the use of an old wind tunnel and reduced capacity due to championship position. He also expressed that they expected rival teams to catch up earlier in 2024 as car designs converge.

You've heard the phrase mentioned in Formula 1, but what is the ""summer shutdown"" and what does it mean? The relentless nature of Formula 1, especially in this record-breaking season with 24 races running from February to December, means that this year's summer shutdown will be a welcome one for drivers and their respective teams. It is an important break that is written into the 2024 FIA F1 sporting regulations. Article 24.1 states that ""competitors must observe a shutdown period of 14 consecutive days during the months of July and/or August."" During this two-week break, teams cannot carry out any work related to the performance of their cars, including design, research, or even communication about the car's performance. However, maintenance work can be carried out by external contractors while regular staff are on leave.

Vowles acknowledged that while Alpine is ahead in points, Sainz's choice reflects a belief in the team's future direction and internal changes. He has focused on long-term success, investing in the team's processes and recruiting senior staff from other F1 teams. Since Vowles took charge, Williams has hired close to 250 people, significantly boosting its workforce. The team's growth is evident, with a notable increase in personnel dedicated to aerodynamics. Vowles believes that the changes being made are fundamental and will lead to success in the future. He is confident that the culture at Williams is evolving, and the team is no longer just making up the numbers in the competition.",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-02 13:33:21+0000

For all the impressive moments in Lando Norris' 2024 Formula 1 season, his approach to starts has been a significant Achilles' heel this year - and has lost him at least two race wins into the first corner. There have been a handful of notable moments in which Norris made inauspicious choices into Turn 1 this year, including his getaways from pole position at the Spanish and Hungarian Grands Prix. At Barcelona, Norris attempted to wrong-foot Max Verstappen into the opening corner, but was outfoxed by a fast-starting George Russell. In Hungary, Oscar Piastri got the better of Norris and held the inside line of the corner, which granted the Australian the early command over the race. Norris has since added another first-lap complication to his record at Spa, after drifting wide on the exit of La Source, costing him momentum and thrusting him down to seventh. It's not necessarily car position that has done for Norris in these instances, but rather the slower-than-ideal starts that restrict what he can do. ""I've given away a lot of points over the last three, four races just because of stupid stuff, mistakes and bad starts - Turn 1 now,"" Norris reflected after the Belgian Grand Prix. The process of breaking through that psychological barrier isn't simple, and he can count on the support of his McLaren team, who are analyzing missed opportunities. If Norris comes back from the summer break and makes a good start to Zandvoort, then the confidence will start to flow; if not, McLaren might need to find a way to stop its title outsider from spiraling.",Formula 1,Autosport,2024-08-02 11:38:50+0000

At face value, the cars that won this year’s Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix and Le Mans 24 Hours share little beyond their Ferrari badges. However, each carries the distinctive logos of fuel and oil giant Shell, which plays a significant role in their performance. Shell’s motorsport delivery manager, Valeria Loreti, emphasizes that their partnerships involve extensive technical discussions aimed at maximizing performance, efficiency, and sustainability. While F1 and MotoGP allow multiple fuel manufacturers, IndyCar teams have used Shell’s renewable race fuel since 2023. The focus on sustainability drives Shell chemists to innovate, resulting in products like the bespoke transmission fluid for BMW’s M Hybrid V8 and Shell’s EV-Plus fluids for Nissan’s Formula E operation. Antonio Giovinazzi, a driver for Ferrari, highlights the importance of reliability in winning races like Le Mans, noting that every detail, including Shell’s contributions, matters. Shell’s trackside laboratory analyzes over 100 fuel and oil samples per Grand Prix weekend, providing critical data for Ferrari’s engineers. Loreti points out that the engine oil is crucial for cooling, cleaning, and protecting the engine, ensuring it performs reliably throughout the race.

Everyone loves a good comeback story, and Formula 1 has enjoyed plenty of them over its nearly 75-year history. As things stand in the current season, Max Verstappen has a 78-point lead over Lando Norris, but he has had to accept that he no longer has the fastest car in F1; McLaren and Mercedes have shared the most recent victories. Red Bull has only a 42-point lead over McLaren in the constructors' standings. If Verstappen and Red Bull fail to lock out the championships this year, it would be the biggest drivers' title swing from mid-season in history. Many have tried to battle against insurmountable odds and failed, such as Damon Hill and Sebastian Vettel in previous seasons. However, there are examples of drivers who overcame considerable odds in the second half of the season to clinch the title. The article reflects on various championship battles, highlighting key moments and shifts in standings throughout the years.

If we were to ask what Jacky Ickx, Alain Prost, and Nigel Mansell have in common, the answer may not be obvious to everyone. They are all Formula 1 legends and the only three drivers who have raced Ferrari, McLaren, and Williams cars at some point in their careers, with Carlos Sainz now set to join them in 2025. Red Bull and Mercedes may be catching up in terms of world championship victories, but they have not been around as long as McLaren and Williams, which have rich histories in the sport. Sainz's journey has been different; he debuted alongside Max Verstappen and later moved to Renault, where he struggled to match his teammate. After a stint at McLaren, where he helped the team recover from a challenging period, Sainz secured a seat at Ferrari. However, he faces tough competition from Charles Leclerc, who has outperformed him in qualifying and points. Sainz's upcoming move to Williams represents a significant challenge, as the team aims to regain its former glory.

Gasly added three top 10s after Monaco, but a did-not-start at Silverstone due to a gearbox problem and a hydraulics issue in Hungary halted his momentum. He struggled in Belgium, lamenting a lack of straight-line speed and engine temperature issues that cost him time. ""It was just very frustrating,"" Gasly said, highlighting the team's mistakes and poor strategies. He noted that the team has scored only 10 points in the first part of the year and must improve in the second half. The team's challenges have been compounded by instability in management, with team principal Bruno Famin announcing his departure ahead of the championship's return.

Lando Norris's battles with Max Verstappen have become a defining narrative of the Formula 1 season, but he faces a tougher rivalry within his own team against Oscar Piastri. While Verstappen is an established great, Piastri represents the internal challenge for Norris at McLaren. To consistently compete with Verstappen, Norris must maintain his status as the team's leader. Piastri's recent successes, including a victory at the Hungaroring, have sparked discussions about his potential to surpass Norris, although Norris has been the stronger driver overall in 2024. He leads in qualifying and race finishes, as well as points scored. Piastri, in only his second season, is still developing, and while he has shown impressive peaks, he needs to improve in areas like single-lap pace and tyre management. The second half of the season is crucial for Norris to prove his championship potential, while Piastri aims to close the gap.

Recruiting a key Red Bull figure to take up the day-to-day running of Audi’s Formula 1 team is a significant opening gambit from Mattia Binotto. The task facing both Binotto and F1’s newest team boss Jonathan Wheatley is monumental given Sauber’s current predicament and the gulf between where that team is now and where the potential of Audi should take it. Binotto’s proactive approach in securing Wheatley is a positive sign for Audi, even if Wheatley won’t start until July 2025. The organization will now have experienced personnel from Ferrari and Red Bull in senior positions, which should help identify and improve areas of weakness. Binotto will oversee Sauber management and technical development, while Wheatley will serve as team principal and public face of the team, focusing on operational management. Sauber has struggled with various technical issues and is currently the only team without a point this season, raising concerns about its performance. The team has consistently failed to develop a car that works effectively across different corner-speed profiles, resulting in it being the slowest car on average in 2024. With the restructuring of Audi’s management and the need for a second driver for 2025, Valtteri Bottas emerges as a strong candidate due to his experience and performance level.

If you aren’t overtly political, then don’t let yourself get dragged into disruptive intra-team politics. In motorsport that’s a must. Erik Comas’ F1 career spanned four seasons in the early 1990s, marked by a single-seater career that had the potential of his contemporary Jean Alesi. Some of his engineers recalled him as ""a special talent who should have achieved much more in F1.” Comas was apolitical, which didn’t help him in a sport often driven by politics. Managerless throughout his career, he faced immense pressure from French state energy company Elf, which likely hindered his progress. By the time he completed two seasons at Ligier, he was already frazzled, and his career trajectory was damaged. Despite a promising start, Comas struggled with the tumultuous environment at Ligier, which was undergoing significant organizational changes.

Red Bull hasn’t only faced intense pressure on track this year; it’s also grappled with the question of whether to stick or twist with its 2025 car. Red Bull’s leadership warned of likely convergence, which has occurred more quickly than hoped. “Convergence has always brought the teams together,” said team principal Christian Horner. Max Verstappen leads the drivers’ championship by 78 points, while Red Bull’s advantage over McLaren in the constructors’ championship is 42 points. The objective for the rest of the season is to maximize the performance of the Red Bull RB20, with further upgrades planned after the August break. However, the focus is shifting to next year’s RB21 and the upcoming 2026 car. Red Bull chief engineer Paul Monaghan highlighted the challenge of balancing development for both the 2025 and 2026 cars. The current RB20 has limitations, particularly in its operating window, which McLaren has managed to optimize better.

Would Red Bull drop Perez if it had Antonelli?,https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/would-red-bull-drop-sergio-perez-if-it-had-antonelli/,"This is an article by The Race. A recent piece from Scott Mitchell-Malm raised the question of whether Red Bull would have replaced Sergio Perez with Kimi Antonelli, a promising talent now signed by Mercedes. This hypothetical scenario highlights a potential failure in Red Bull's driver program, as they lack comparable young talent in their ranks. Recent signings like Nyck de Vries and Daniel Ricciardo have come from outside the team, raising concerns about the effectiveness of their development pipeline. Antonelli, currently seventh in the Formula 2 championship, has not performed at a level that would justify replacing Perez, who, despite his struggles, remains a safer option for the team. Red Bull's decision-making appears conservative, especially in light of their recent competitive struggles, and they have not produced elite talents at the same rate as rivals like Mercedes and Ferrari. The team has also faced criticism for its cutthroat approach, which may have led to a talent logjam, preventing the emergence of new stars. As Red Bull looks to the future, the pressure to make the right driver choice is greater than ever, especially with the constructors' championship at stake.

F1's driver sharing tactic IndyCar teams must employ,https://www.the-race.com/indycar/f1-driver-sharing-tactic-indycar-teams-must-employ/,"This is an article by The Race. Surely having someone travel over 4000 miles to jump in a car they've only raced five times before, on about four hours sleep, to drive in a street-fighting qualifying session on a track they’ve never driven isn't ideal? That's what Theo Pourchaire did for the McLaren IndyCar team in Toronto last month, which makes you think: why don’t IndyCar teams have a reserve driver they can access at all races? I can understand in the past why IndyCar teams haven't had reserve drivers. It's a significant cost to consider, those drivers need to be racing elsewhere to stay match-fit, and there might not always be drivers good enough available for an IndyCar back-up job. However, when looking at how many times stand-ins have been needed in the last five years, it's roughly two races per season, which is significant. Formula 1 has provided a blueprint for how you can move forward in a cost-effective way with reserve drivers: you share them. IndyCar could have one or two reserve drivers per manufacturer with Chevrolet and Honda, or just have one driver who can be available for the whole grid. This would help keep a driver in work and allow teams to use the reserve to entertain sponsors, freeing up race drivers to focus on their performance. Remaining in the paddock would give any drivers not chosen for a seat the chance to keep face-time with team bosses and be ready if an opportunity arose.",Formula 1,The Race,2024-08-06 12:30:00+0000

Fast forward to today, as we face significant climate change, the impact on our mental states is becoming increasingly evident. Research indicates that higher temperatures correlate with various negative outcomes, including increased domestic violence, lower educational performance, and heightened aggression. The climate crisis not only affects our external environment but also our internal states, suggesting a profound interconnectedness. Recent studies have shown that climate change may exacerbate neurological conditions and influence mental health, with evidence linking temperature fluctuations to increased hospitalizations for psychiatric disorders. As we explore the relationship between climate and cognition, it becomes clear that our brains are vulnerable to environmental changes. Understanding this connection could inform strategies for climate adaptation and pro-environmental decision-making, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to tackle the psychological impacts of climate change. Ultimately, as the climate crisis evolves, so too must our understanding of its effects on the human mind and behavior.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-13 10:00:00+0000
North Putnam,https://aeon.co/videos/scenes-from-a-school-year-paint-a-refreshingly-nuanced-portrait-of-rural-america?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. The feature-length documentary North Putnam follows a year at a public school district in rural Indiana, chronicling the many ways in which community and education intersect in this small slice of the American Midwest. This excerpt from the documentary features a series of interconnected moments from the North Putnam School Corporation and the region it serves. This includes frank discussions between students and teachers about the challenges the school district faces; moments from a contentious school board meeting; the ritual of a high-school football game; depictions of the region’s deep ties to agriculture and faith; and scenes from the Putnam County criminal justice system, where some parents of students make their living, and others are incarcerated. In his depiction, director Joel Fendelman provides a refreshingly honest view of one small slice of the United States where many live below the poverty line – and especially the challenges educators face. The film is a project by the North Putnam Putnam County-based nonprofit organisation The Castle, which aims to inject a sense of play and joy back into the classroom for teachers and their students.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-12 10:01:00+0000
Falling for suburbia,https://aeon.co/essays/why-millions-of-britons-fell-in-love-with-suburban-life?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. As a seven-year boy, John Edwin Smith was taken by his father to see paradise. Living in a cramped tenement in Lewisham, he had hitherto considered the high street’s clock tower the very edge of the universe. But one Sunday morning, a year after the end of the First World War, John was taken on an open-top bus ride for the first time. The Smiths had arrived on the Downham Estate, one of 13 ‘cottage estates’ built by the London County Council in the interwar years as part of a huge social and economic transformation of Britain. The prime minister David Lloyd George believed new houses and gardens could soothe potential uprisings, leading to the building of 5 million new homes before the outbreak of the Second World War. The housebuilding campaign was driven by the Garden City movement, which emphasized access to open space for the health of the population. Young John watched as his father, a bricklayer, went to work on their tiny corner of this new Britain, motivated by the desire to create a garden. Despite the ridicule of suburban gardens, this period marked the real birth of Britain as a ‘land of gardeners’. Richard Sudell, a working-class gardener, played a significant role in promoting suburban gardens and alleviating poverty through gardening initiatives. His efforts, alongside those of others, highlighted the importance of gardens in creating a more civilised and egalitarian society.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-12 10:00:00+0000
Rawls the redeemer,https://aeon.co/essays/john-rawls-liberalism-and-what-it-means-to-live-a-good-life?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. John Rawls, the preeminent political philosopher of the 20th century, lived a quiet life after a tragic youth, dedicating nearly 40 years to academia at Harvard University. His work transformed our understanding of justice, fairness, and liberalism, and he is remembered for his genuine kindness and unshowy goodness. Despite his calm demeanor, Rawls had charming eccentricities, such as incorporating his philosophical concepts into family Christmas plays. In a personal interview draft, he posed hypothetical questions to himself, revealing a deeper inquiry into the worthiness of human life beyond institutional justice. Rawls believed that ordinary life needs to be elevated by something beyond itself, which he found in liberalism. As religion declines in the Western world, many unchurched individuals struggle to identify the source of their values, often defaulting to personal experience or familial influence. In his book, ""Liberalism as a Way of Life,"" Lefebvre argues that liberalism itself can serve as this source, embodying values of personal freedom, fairness, and tolerance. The ethical dimension of liberalism, once central to its founders, has been overshadowed by a focus on legal and political frameworks. Rawls's concept of fairness as a defining ideal of liberal democracy emphasizes that society should function as a fair system of cooperation, accessible to all citizens. Ultimately, embracing Rawls's principles can lead to a more meaningful and generous life, fostering empathy and resilience in a world rife with inequality.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-09 10:00:00+0000

Mere imitation,https://aeon.co/essays/is-ai-our-salvation-our-undoing-or-just-more-of-the-same?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. Here’s the quandary when it comes to AI: have we found our way to salvation, a portal to an era of convenience and luxury heretofore unknown? Or have we met our undoing, a dystopia that will decimate society as we know it? These contradictions are at least partly due to another – somewhat latent – contradiction. We are fascinated by AI’s outputs (the what) at a superficial level but are often disenchanted if we dig a bit deeper, or otherwise try to understand AI’s process (the how). This quandary has never been so apparent as in these times of generative AI. We are enamoured by the excellent form of outputs produced by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT while being worried about the biased and unrealistic narratives they churn out. Similarly, we find AI art very appealing, while being concerned by the lack of deeper meaning, not to mention concerns about plagiarising the geniuses of yesteryear. The dissonance between human-like presentation and machine-like ethos is at the heart of the AI quandary, too. Yet it would be wrong to think that AI’s obsession with superficial imitation is recent.

Saviour siblings,https://aeon.co/videos/is-it-ethical-to-have-a-second-child-so-that-your-first-might-live?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. ‘Saviour siblings’ are children who are conceived so that they might provide a transplant to an older sibling with a life-threatening illness. While such cases are a medical rarity, they raise important ethical questions – both for the families that must make a choice about conceiving a saviour sibling, and for society at large. Is this a situation where intense emotions can cloud ethics for parents, and risk devaluing the ‘saviour sibling’ as a person in their own right? Or is it morally justified, especially in cases where parents planned to conceive an additional child regardless? This short explores the perspectives of two parents and several faith leaders on the ethics of saviour siblings, including one mother who had a daughter that ultimately saved her son’s life.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-07 10:01:00+0000
Your body is an archive,https://aeon.co/essays/how-do-we-transmit-culture-when-it-cannot-be-put-into-words?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. You can’t speak like they spoke. You can’t farm like they farmed. In fact, most of the cultural practices your distant ancestors learned have not reached you. Those chains of knowledge can be incredibly brittle, and without physical records, cultural knowledge can easily break down and disappear. Think of the music of Mesopotamia; the only reason we can still attempt to play it today is because ancient Sumerians inscribed the notation for their songs into stone tablets. This loss of knowledge is not simply because it wasn’t written down; many cultural practices likely can’t be recorded. Cultural transmission is a term used to describe how certain forms of knowledge are passed between people, often requiring firsthand experience rather than mere observation or language. Recognizing how difficult it is to transmit cultural practices, UNESCO has been working to preserve ‘intangible cultural heritage’, which includes many traditions that might become extinct. Understanding how cultural transmission exploits relationships in a network of ‘bits’ can help preserve current knowledge and provide insight into new cultural practices that might be discovered in the future.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-06 10:00:00+0000
Forest crayons,https://aeon.co/videos/watch-as-japans-surplus-trees-are-transformed-into-forest-tinted-crayons?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. Following Japan’s efforts to rebuild after the devastation of the Second World War, roughly 70 per cent of the country’s land is now covered in trees – more than double the average of countries around the world. Today, the rise of the global supply chain means most commercial wood is imported from abroad. This has left Japan with ‘basically way too much wood’, as the UK artist Dan Coppen puts it in this short from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The video highlights a project by Coppen and his creative partner, the Japanese artist Saki Maruyama, who together form the design and art duo Playfool, to repurpose trees in inventive ways. Participating in a residency programme funded by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the pair ultimately created a set of ‘forest crayons’ fashioned from the wood of a variety of Japanese trees. They hope their invention will help users ‘cultivate a closer relationship with forests’ that surround them. The project is, of course, not a practical plan for the nation’s overabundance of trees.

Empowering patient research,https://aeon.co/essays/we-need-the-first-hand-experience-of-disabled-researchers?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. One of us – Joanne Hunt (Jo) – has been largely confined to the house for more than a decade, sometimes bedbound for weeks or months at a time. Jo’s primary diagnoses, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), mean that her daily activities are severely restricted. Most clinicians still struggle to know how to treat hEDS, creating a devastating obstruction to care for patients with rare conditions. The traditional model for researching disabilities often involves able-bodied researchers conducting studies on disabled individuals, which can overlook the unique insights that patients can provide. Emerging evidence shows that patient-researchers can enhance clinical knowledge, as seen in oncology studies where their involvement improved trial outcomes significantly. Rosamund Snow, a pioneer in patient-research, demonstrated how patients could challenge clinical assumptions and improve healthcare practices. Similarly, Liz Salmi and Sara Riggare have made substantial contributions to understanding patient experiences and advocating for patient access to medical records and self-research. Despite their achievements, patient-researchers often face epistemic injustice, where their insights are undervalued compared to traditional researchers. To foster a more inclusive academic environment, it is essential to embrace the voices of disabled individuals in healthcare research, which could lead to innovative solutions and a deeper understanding of their conditions.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-05 10:00:00+0000
Seeing plants anew,https://aeon.co/essays/what-plant-philosophy-says-about-plant-agency-and-intelligence?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. It was once common in Western societies to think of plants as passive and inert, lacking the agency and intelligence attributed to animals. However, recent developments in plant sciences have revealed the extraordinary complexity of plants' interactions with their environment and each other. The study of plant behavior has shown that plants exhibit responses akin to behaviors directed towards self-preservation, such as releasing volatile organic compounds when wounded, which can repel herbivores or attract their predators. Research indicates that plants can even recognize kin and respond differently to them compared to non-kin. This emerging understanding challenges long-held assumptions about the nature of life and agency, suggesting that plants possess properties previously thought exclusive to animals. Philosophers are now engaging with these findings, leading to the development of ""plant philosophy,"" which seeks to explore the implications of plant life for broader philosophical questions. This new field examines how the peculiarities of plant existence challenge traditional metaphysical distinctions, such as individual/collective and life/death. As scientists and philosophers collaborate, they are beginning to redefine concepts like intelligence and agency in ways that include plant life. The challenge remains to conceptualize plant behaviors without resorting to anthropocentric interpretations, aiming instead to appreciate plants as distinct beings that contribute to our existence. Contemporary plant philosophy is just beginning to explore these questions, with many answers still open for investigation.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-02 10:00:00+0000

Sexual sensation,https://aeon.co/essays/what-explains-the-variations-in-sexual-sensation-between-us?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. Growing up in Los Angeles in the 1970s, I gradually came to realize that my father was not the stereotypical psychoanalyst. He had the trappings of a psychoanalyst, but he also possessed the skeptical and logical mind of a physician. Our Wednesday night dinners often included discussions about his psychoanalytic clients, blending psychodynamic talk with emerging neuroscience. He believed that when the talking cure worked, it did so by changing the cellular and molecular structure of the brain, rather than through Freudian concepts. This perspective was evident in a case where he identified a client’s depression as stemming from thyroid hormone deficiency rather than childhood trauma. As I grew older, I admired his intellectual flexibility and chose to pursue neuroscience, focusing on the biological understanding of brain function. The biology of sexual sensation, particularly the role of Krause corpuscles in the genitals, has been a significant area of research, revealing that these structures are mechanoreceptors that convey sensations to the brain. Recent studies have shown that Krause corpuscles in the clitoris are more sensitive than those in the penis, suggesting a biological basis for sexual sensation. This research raises questions about how individual differences in sexual experience may be influenced by both biological and early life experiences. Ultimately, while psychoanalytic theories emphasize the role of social experience, the emerging neuroscience highlights the importance of our biological makeup in shaping sexual individuality.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-08-01 10:00:00+0000

In doing so, the group, which is composed of Black and Latinx performers, seeks to fight hopelessness and send the message that ‘a different reality is possible’ for residents of the city, which has one of the highest violent crime rates of any urban centre in the United States. The short documentary Black Strings follows the ensemble as they sit ‘on call’, monitoring police, ambulance and fire department radios, awaiting a situation they deem suitable for a performance.

The paradoxes of Mikhaâil Mishaqa,https://aeon.co/essays/the-life-of-mishaqa-and-the-birth-of-arab-ottoman-modernity?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. The 19th-century Middle East presents a paradox. On one hand, the idea of a modern, secular society became possible, while on the other, newly divisive religious identities emerged. Intellectuals across the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire created a modern public sphere, characterized by a vibrant periodical press and cultural associations where Muslims, Christians, and Jews engaged in debates about society, science, and culture. However, these regions were also marked by significant conflicts between religious communities, notably in Lebanon and Syria, culminating in violent events like the 1860 massacre in Damascus. Amidst this backdrop, individuals like Mikha’il Mishaqa navigated the tensions between scientific rationalism and religious revival. Arriving in Damietta in 1817, Mishaqa was exposed to diverse belief systems and began to question religion, influenced by Enlightenment ideas and the contradictions he observed in responses to the plague. His journey led him from deism to a rational form of Christianity, where he sought to reconcile faith with reason. Mishaqa's life illustrates the intertwined roots of secularism and religious identity in the Arab-Ottoman world, a legacy that continues to shape cultural discourse today. The emergence of both secular and religious revivalist projects reflects a shared transition towards justifying beliefs through reason, highlighting the complex dynamics of modernity in the region.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-07-30 10:00:00+0000

However, the six-rayed sea star (Leptasterias hexactis) stands out for its active approach to raising its young. Capturing its lifecycle via stunning 4K microscopy, this video explores how these starfish ‘brood’, keeping their offspring close until they’re ready to venture out on their own. By tending to far fewer offspring than their broadcast spawning cousins, while giving them a far higher chance of survival, these fascinating sea creatures demonstrate there are myriad ways to parent in the animal kingdom.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-07-29 10:01:00+0000
Frameworks,https://aeon.co/essays/the-realist-vs-the-pragmatist-view-of-epistemology?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Aeon. How could gaining knowledge amount to anything other than discovering what was already there? Some philosophers have argued that knowledge is not merely a matter of representation but also of construction, and that truth cannot be completely detached from human needs and interests. John Dewey, for example, argued that the object of knowledge is the product of enquiry and not something that exists independently of that enquiry. However, this view seems problematic, as scientists have discovered facts like DNA and gravity, which existed prior to their investigations. The realist view sees enquiry as a process of revelation, where knowledge represents antecedent facts. Not all enquiries are straightforward; some require a more complex understanding where the object of investigation evolves as the enquiry progresses. The distinction between framed and framing enquiries is crucial, as framed enquiries operate within established frameworks, while framing enquiries involve the creation or revision of those frameworks. This distinction impacts how we navigate daily enquiries, especially in social and political contexts, where differing frameworks can lead to unproductive arguments. Understanding when we are engaged in a framed or framing enquiry is essential for effective communication and decision-making.",Self Dev,Aeon,2024-07-29 10:00:00+0000

If you’re having trouble getting over an ex, you know exactly how painful lingering feelings of love can be. Love for an ex can prompt longing or deep regret, disrupting your sleep or appetite, and leading to jealousy, anxiety, or self-loathing. It can seem as if nothing matters except the fact that this person is no longer in your life. Loving a former romantic partner is especially likely when the breakup was unexpected, but you can continue to feel love for an ex even when you ended the relationship. To get over an ex, you must grapple directly with love, as it is often misguided and unhelpful. Acting on these emotions can cause problems, such as isolating yourself from friends or obsessively checking on your ex. The DBT skill of ‘opposite action’ can help you reduce unhelpful emotions by encouraging you to act contrary to what those emotions urge you to do. Before practicing opposite action, it’s important to validate your feelings and understand them. Techniques such as listing reasons your ex is not good for you, avoiding contact, and distracting yourself from obsessive thoughts can help diminish feelings of love. Ultimately, while it may take time and repeated efforts, your love for your ex can fade, allowing you to focus on enjoying your life.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-08-14 10:00:00+0000
What if we learned contemplation like we do arts or sports?,https://psyche.co/ideas/what-if-we-learned-contemplation-like-we-do-arts-or-sports?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. When I was a child, I was introduced to contemplative practices that changed my life. Starting in the fourth grade, I regularly walked to my grandmother’s house after school, where she guided me to close my eyes, rest my body, and enter new imaginal worlds. Over time, she taught me how to calm my body with my breath and focus my attention, skills that I now appreciate deeply as a researcher. Contemplation refers to a diverse suite of practices that enhance individuals, communities, and lived worlds. Historically, these practices were intertwined with cultural and philosophical dimensions, but they have become marginalized in many societies. I believe that the domains of arts and sports can help reacquaint people with contemplative practices, as both cultivate valuable life skills. Contemplative practices train cognitive, emotional, imaginal, and embodied dimensions of being human, enhancing skills like attentional focus and emotional regulation. Educational institutions need to place a higher value on the inner life of young people by equipping them with contemplative toolkits. Schools should offer personalized contemplative training, recognizing the importance of these life-enhancing skills.

Brown Brit,https://psyche.co/films/three-sisters-craft-a-lyrical-tribute-to-their-mother-from-old-family-vhs-tapes?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. The UK filmmaker Jay Stephen’s mother, Aju, had known her future husband for just seven hours before they were married in an arranged ceremony in India in 1987. At 22 years old, her life’s path seemed laid out without her input. Soon, she was pursuing the ‘great British dream’ in London, caught between identities as she adopted a Westernised look and tried to hide her accent. Her three daughters became the ‘three legs of a tripod’ used to stabilise the wobbly foundation of her marriage. In the short film Brown Brit, each of these three ‘legs’ celebrates their mother’s love, sacrifice and, later, her brave decision to make her own path. For the work, Stephen and her filmmaking partner Ralph Briscoe repurposed 12 years of family VHS footage to tell Aju’s story. The images are paired with a lyrical essay by Stephen’s sister, Ashica Stephen, which describes Aju’s stifling life – and her ultimate decision to break free of it. The third sister, Deepica Stephen, provides an emotive voiceover and depicts Aju in the newly shot scenes that close out the film.

Why Charlie Chaplin was an âangel of peaceâ for Walter Benjamin,https://psyche.co/ideas/why-charlie-chaplin-was-an-angel-of-peace-for-walter-benjamin?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. In early April 1932, Walter Benjamin boarded a mail boat headed for the Mediterranean island of Ibiza, seeking refuge from the upheavals in Germany and his failure to secure an academic position. The island allowed him to live simply, devoid of modern comforts, reflecting on the impossibility of long-range plans amidst global chaos. His writings from this period, particularly the ‘Ibizan Sequence’, explore the nature of willpower and opportunity, challenging the notion that success is solely a product of will. Benjamin distinguishes between objective opportunities, which are external and time-sensitive, and subjective opportunities, which depend on an individual's perception and readiness to act. He argues that recognizing an opportunity requires experience, as the inexperienced may overlook potential chances. This leads to a deeper understanding of success, which is not merely about willpower but also about the ability to seize moments as they arise. Benjamin illustrates this with the example of Charlie Chaplin, whose character embodies a unique fit with the world, despite often failing. Chaplin's experiences highlight the distinction between achievement and fortunate existence, suggesting that true nobility lies in how one navigates life's absurdities.

What a dream helped me see about the politics of sovereignty,https://psyche.co/ideas/what-a-dream-helped-me-see-about-the-politics-of-sovereignty?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. We live in a scientistic, rationalistic culture that smirks at the idea that our dreams can teach us. Recently, I had a dream where I was asked about the tendency in our civilization to couch claims in terms of sovereignty, whether by nations, corporations, or individuals. I realized that these claims are expressions of our current crisis, and we cannot transform our civilization unless we replace the sovereignty model with a relational way of thinking. There is no sovereignty in nature, only interconnectedness. True autonomy must be relational; we become free by being with each other and recognizing our interdependence. The dominance of sovereignty leads to a culture of grievance, where victimhood becomes a mask for aggression. This is evident in identity politics, which can perpetuate the very ideologies it seeks to challenge. We must engage in real dialogue that transcends side-picking and allows for a unity that respects differences. Sovereigntism, as an ideology, is dangerous because it fosters separation and rivalry. To create a better world, we must embrace our inter-being and move beyond attachment to sovereignty.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-08-06 10:00:00+0000
Itâs not just youthâs happy memories that have a special weight,https://psyche.co/ideas/its-not-just-youths-happy-memories-that-have-a-special-weight?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. Life is full of joyful experiences, milestones, and triumphs that stick with us – a graduation, wedding, birth, or simple hike in the mountains can linger in memory for a very long time. Humans have an extraordinary capacity to engage in mental time travel, which confers numerous psychological benefits, ranging from helping us manage emotions to maintaining a coherent, stable life narrative and sense of self. Scientific studies have consistently found that when people over 40 reflect on their lives, they tend to have a favorite temporal destination: adolescence and young adulthood. This is the life period when a person typically discovers who they are and their place in their society, making events from this period more memorable than those from other life stages. Psychologists call this phenomenon the ‘reminiscence bump’. While people are inclined to relive pleasant memories from these years, it turns out that painfully embarrassing moments also stick around, becoming defining features in our life stories. The reminiscence bump is a global phenomenon, observed in different countries, and memories from this period remain intact longer for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. Recent studies have shown that certain negative memories, particularly those associated with embarrassment, shame, and regret, also exhibit the reminiscence bump. These memories may serve as valuable lessons, helping individuals avoid similar situations in the future. Retaining these troublesome memories could be especially valuable to personal growth, aiding in the development of a positive sense of self as life unfolds.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-08-05 10:00:00+0000

My Love, Your Love instantly pulls you into its universe. With scenes built of rippling lines and brilliant colours, the Malaysian artist Gabriel Gabriel Garble crafts an animation that’s strange and entrancing at every turn. The film’s somewhat enigmatic narrative follows the journey of a young boy who, in the wake of a tragedy, borrows a friend’s prosthetic arm, and, with it, seems to experience his surroundings anew. The vivid, ever-fluctuating imagery and dreamy synth score evoke a psychedelic trip – the rapturous kind, in which one perceives a sort of unity with the natural environment around them. It’s a cliché way to frame a mind-bending animation, but the heightened sensory experience it kindles makes the comparison all but unavoidable. Still, one needn’t have any interest in or experience with mind-altering chemicals to find wonder within Garble’s creation. This is experimental film at its best – a work of ceaseless, breathless creativity that absorbs the viewer while inviting them to reexamine their world.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-08-02 10:01:00+0000
Rewilding attachment theory by recognising Earth as a caregiver,https://psyche.co/ideas/rewilding-attachment-theory-by-recognising-earth-as-a-caregiver?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. In the 1950s, psychologists John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth began studying the impact of human relationships on children's emotional development, leading to the revolutionary concept of attachment theory. They emphasized the importance of emotional security, finding that children actively seek this security in their attachments with caregivers. Bowlby suggested that adults' emotional worlds could be traced back to their childhood attachments, with securely attached individuals typically having responsive parents. However, Bowlby also recognized that emotional distress could be influenced by broader social environments, making it a social problem requiring structural solutions. 

Recent research suggests that the natural world plays a significant role in our emotional lives, potentially offering a sense of security and belonging that parallels secure attachments formed in childhood. The concept of ""rewilding"" attachment theory proposes that we should consider the ecological relationships that impact our emotional wellbeing. Studies indicate that even brief exposure to nature can reduce stress and anxiety, highlighting the importance of our connection to the Earth. 

As urbanization increases, many people are physically removed from nature, limiting their emotional connections to the environment. To address this, we need a psychological framework that acknowledges our emotional dependence on the Earth, potentially rewilding attachment theory to include these vital ecological connections. This expanded perspective suggests that healing can come not only from social relationships but also from rekindling our connection to the natural world.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-08-01 10:00:00+0000
Your 10-step plan for achieving a creative breakthrough,https://psyche.co/ideas/your-10-step-plan-for-achieving-a-creative-breakthrough?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. In his autobiography, Charles Darwin wrote that one day, simply ‘for amusement’, he happened to read an essay discussing the Malthusian principle, which proposed that a population grows while the available resources don’t change. This led him to realize that under these circumstances, favorable variations would tend to be preserved, resulting in the formation of new species. Such moments of clarity, often referred to as Aha! moments, are not rare; many crucial discoveries in various fields have been achieved through sudden insights. When faced with complex problems, our brains switch from relying on prior knowledge to seeking fresh perspectives, often leading to these enlightening moments. Psychologists have studied insights for over a century, revealing that they differ from conventional solutions in both subjective experience and neural activity. Aha! moments are associated with a surge of high-frequency gamma waves in the right temporal lobe, indicating a distinct brain signature. To cultivate these insights, one can follow a three-stage process: Preparation, Incubation, and Insight. Recognizing an impasse is crucial, as it often precedes an Aha! moment, and maintaining a positive mood can enhance the likelihood of achieving insights. Engaging in non-engaging activities or allowing for mind-wandering can also facilitate the incubation process, leading to unexpected connections. Finally, once insights occur, it’s important to capture and verify them to ensure their validity.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-07-31 10:00:00+0000
Menopause was a French invention at a time of revolution,https://psyche.co/ideas/menopause-was-a-french-invention-at-a-time-of-revolution?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. Have women in all historical and present cultures suffered the ailments of menopause we know about today? Studies in medical history and anthropology indicate wide variability in how women have experienced it globally. For instance, Japanese women interviewed in the 1990s described their primary complaint of midlife as shoulder stiffness, not hot flushes. Menopause was first defined by young male university students and their medical professors in France from the end of the 1700s, becoming a major topic throughout the 19th century. The French were particularly fascinated by menopause, associating it with nervous pathologies like vapours, hysteria, and hypochondria, which were thought to be products of urban life and luxury. French doctors began to view women as more prone to illness during times of uterine change, leading to a medical discourse that advised urban women to mimic peasant diets to avoid the ravages of menopause. Despite the recognition that more women than men were living into old age, French medicine continued to view menopause as a health crisis. The emergence of the term ""la ménopause"" in post-revolutionary Paris signified a new scientific identity, with medical theses flourishing on the topic. By the 1850s, women began authoring medical works on menopause, often viewing it as a natural life phase rather than a medical problem. Today, the legacy of the French pathologisation of menopause continues to influence perceptions and treatments, with a growing market for products targeting women in midlife.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-07-30 10:00:00+0000

My dad had a bad death. The lead-up was long – a decade-old stroke had forced an early retirement from carpentry – but the end was abrupt, avoidable. A slip getting into bed caused a brain bleed, invisible and irrevocable by the time his roommate found him the next day. My sister and I, both in the thick of COVID-19 bouts, needed special permission to enter the hospital. In the final moments, we curled across pairs of chairs pushed together beside him until his familiar snores gave way to silence. A year and a half later, the fog has lifted considerably, but one thing that remains is the spectre of self-blame. I left so many signs unheeded, plans half-laid. We hadn’t spoken for the three weeks preceding his death. Ruminating on what might have been is normal, but it can be useful to challenge the ‘what ifs’ when they surface. The kind of self-blame I have experienced may be especially common among loved ones of the deceased in the wake of so-called ‘bad’ deaths.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-07-29 10:00:00+0000
Helen Pashgian: visible invisible,https://psyche.co/films/toxic-materials-become-sculptures-of-light-and-air-in-this-artists-hands?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. As an artist in residence at Caltech in the mid 1960s, Helen Pashgian pioneered new applications of resins, urethanes, and epoxies – materials that had previously been developed for use by the military. In this short documentary produced by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), her exacting process and its luminous results are captured by the LA-based filmmaker Anika Kan Grevstad. Developed through decades of experimentation, Pashgian’s methods shape these temperamental and highly toxic materials into sculptures that, in turn, shape the light around them. Despite the space-age look of these artworks, and the technical precision and synthetic materials involved in their production, Pashgian’s pieces reflect a deep connection to the natural world. Pashgian traces her fascination with light and water to the land- and seascapes of Pasadena in southern California, where she grew up and still lives and works – in particular, the interplay of transparency and opacity she’d observed in the sea lapping on the shore. Her works, and those of other Californian artists of the Light and Space movement, were dismissed at the time by East Coast art critics for being insubstantial, all about atmosphere and air – but it is these very qualities that Pashgian seeks to capture in her attempts at ‘making the invisible visible’.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-07-26 10:01:00+0000

After waiting for over an hour, I abandoned hope and headed back uptown, only to receive a call from him apologizing for his tardiness. Kahneman, who died on 27 March 2024 at the age of 90, spent his life thinking about mistakes, which made him an academic superstar. His ideas about human thinking and behavior infiltrated various fields, most dramatically in economics, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 2002. Kahneman and his research partner, Amos Tversky, spent years exploring human rationality, revealing that our responses are often influenced by how scenarios are framed. Later in life, he focused on happiness, developing the concept of the ""peak-end rule,"" which suggests we remember experiences based on their most intense moments and their conclusion.

How to look after your emotional health,https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-look-after-your-emotional-needs-with-human-givens-therapy?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. The human givens (HG) approach to therapy, developed in 1997 by Joe Griffin and Ivan Tyrrell, emphasizes the importance of meeting essential emotional and physical needs for mental health. This framework suggests that unmet needs can lead to mental health issues, as evidenced by studies showing that individuals with lower control and support in their work environments experience higher levels of illness. The HG approach identifies several basic emotional needs critical for wellbeing, such as connection, status, and meaning, and highlights the adverse effects of loneliness and lack of respect on mental health.

Additionally, the misuse of innate psychological resources, like memory and imagination, can contribute to poor mental health. For example, negative pattern matching can lead individuals to focus on past failures rather than successes, impacting their confidence. The HG perspective encourages individuals to identify unmet needs and misused resources, viewing symptoms not as personal failings but as indicators of these unmet needs.

To assess one's emotional wellbeing, the emotional needs audit (ENA) can be a useful tool, allowing individuals to rate how well their needs are being met. Following the audit, individuals are encouraged to brainstorm solutions to improve low scores and address needs in healthier ways. Ultimately, the HG approach aims to empower individuals to make meaningful changes in their lives, fostering better mental health through understanding and addressing their emotional needs.",Self Dev,Psyche,2024-07-24 10:00:00+0000

In 1999, when James McKillop was diagnosed with dementia at 59, doctors told him to prepare for death, but he found hope in advocacy. Many view dementia as a ""living death,"" but McKillop and others argue for a shift in perception, advocating for humane and scientific post-diagnostic support. Dementia encompasses various diseases affecting the brain, and its understanding has evolved since its identification by Alois Alzheimer in 1906. Research now suggests that factors beyond brain biology, such as social participation and environmental influences, play significant roles in dementia's onset. The concept of ""meeting centres"" has emerged, providing supportive environments where individuals with dementia can engage socially and maintain cognitive activity. Studies show that these centres help people live independently longer compared to traditional care settings. Authors and researchers emphasize the importance of recognizing the intact capacities of those with dementia, advocating for a world that accommodates their needs. The experiences of individuals like Willy Gilder, who found renewed creativity through music, highlight the potential for growth despite cognitive decline.

Take a seat: the long table is an antidote to loneliness,https://psyche.co/ideas/take-a-seat-the-long-table-is-an-antidote-to-loneliness?utm_source=rss-feed,"This is an article by Psyche. Modern institutions often make significant mistakes in designing communal dining spaces, particularly in the choice of small tables. These little tables, intended to create intimacy, can actually foster social isolation and discomfort among diners. In contrast, long, continuous dining tables encourage community and connection, allowing individuals to sit alongside one another and engage in conversation. At Graduate House in Sydney, the implementation of long tables has transformed the dining experience, promoting a culture where no one eats alone. The ""club room rule"" ensures that diners take the next available seat, facilitating interactions among residents and reducing the intimidation of sitting next to someone new. This arrangement not only enhances social bonds but also diminishes the tendency to form cliques. The benefits of long tables extend beyond academic institutions; they can also enhance the atmosphere in cafés, restaurants, and family gatherings. By fostering a sense of community, long tables serve as a remedy for the loneliness prevalent in modern life.

The most terrifying moments often unfold in mundane situations. My own taste of horror emerges every time I enter a bar and I’m met with a prolonged silence after asking: ‘Can I use the toilet, please?’ In supposedly affluent Western nations, the dire state or absence of public toilets has become a universal nightmare, impacting the health and quality of life of all of us, particularly for marginalized groups. Making public bathrooms accessible and appropriate is a matter of human dignity. Toilets were one of the biggest steps forward for humanity, allowing us to create cleaner spaces and improving health. Yet, the vast majority of public restrooms have not embraced the aspect of wellbeing, often eliciting disgust and repulsion. The toilet problem has two branches: the global sanitation crisis in developing countries and the issues in developed countries that negatively impact daily life. Fear of public bathrooms is greater in those most disadvantaged by society, and the lack of access to toilets is a silent global burden.

Kamala Harris Had a Great Health Care Idea in 2019. She Should Embrace It.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/opinion/kamala-harris-health-care.html,"This is an article by New York Times. From the moment Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Republicans have sought to paint her as a far-left California liberal. However, Ms. Harris didn’t seek to eliminate private insurance in 2019; her core health plan was an intelligently designed “public option.” This plan aimed to encourage Americans to buy into a revamped Medicare program, offering the choice of public or private coverage. As the so-called father of the public option, I believe her 2019 proposal remains the strongest ever put forth by a presidential candidate. She should embrace it as a central part of her 2024 campaign, as it represents both smart policy and smart politics.

Health care is “unbelievably complex,” and Americans are frustrated with the current system's high prices and insecure coverage. The G.O.P.’s failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act showed that a majority of Americans do not want to return to pre-A.C.A. conditions. This issue has unified the Democratic Party, intertwining with topics like abortion, maternal health, and the economic security of working families. However, there is still disagreement within the party on the primary health care policy goal, with progressives advocating for universal Medicare and moderates calling for an upgraded A.C.A. with a public option.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-14 14:36:41+0000
Catholic Converts Like JD Vance Are Reshaping Republican Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/opinion/jd-vance-catholic-convert-republican.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Despite institutional decline and internal conflict, Catholicism retains a surprising resonance in American life, particularly in elite circles. It has emerged as a vibrant religious group at many top universities and claims six of the nine Supreme Court justices as adherents. The Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism after attending Yale Law School, exemplifies this phenomenon. He joined an influential group of conservative converts who share a combination of social conservatism and a willingness to question the free-market orthodoxies of the pre-Trump Republican Party. This group’s economic thinking distinguishes its members from earlier conservative Catholic intellectuals who emphasized free markets due to the threat of Soviet Communism.

For Vance and others, Catholicism serves as a resource to push back against the excesses of cultural and economic liberalism. Many contemporary converts aim to resist the left-right fusion of libertarian cultural attitudes and free-market economics that has reshaped Western society. Rather than precipitating a radical overhaul, they have exerted a subtler influence, altering how the Republican Party approaches policy and helping to build a new consensus across party lines.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:02:13+0000

Thailand’s Royal Spell Has Been Broken,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/opinion/thailand-royalists-king-democracy.html,"This is an article by New York Times. On the surface, Thailand appears to be stuck in a never-ending cycle. Elections are held in which voters voice increasingly clear demands for change, only for those to be denied by the royalist old guard that has dominated my country for generations. Each of the past several elections, going back to 2005, have resulted in the winning party either being denied its right to form a government, overthrown in a military coup or otherwise removed from office. 

So when Thailand’s Constitutional Court last week ordered the dissolution of the country’s most popular political party — the pro-reform Move Forward Party — it seemed like déjà vu, the latest chapter in a normalized process of political stagnation. But in reality, what we are seeing is the beginning of the end for the Thai royalty’s once-commanding hold over its subjects, which could mean great change ahead for a traditional kingdom at the center of Southeast Asia. 

The court decision is not a sign of the strength of the conservative establishment, but of its weakness; a last-gasp attempt by the old guard to cling to an outdated status quo despite demands for change by millions of politically literate young Thais. The Move Forward Party had called for several reforms, including a reduction in the entrenched political power of the Thai military. Its main objective was the reform of Thailand’s lèse-majesté laws, which many Thais view as an anachronistic impediment to the country’s development as a modern, democratic nation. 

Last week’s court decision was the final blow: Move Forward was dissolved, and key members were banned from politics for 10 years.

Naftali Bennett Needs to Topple Two Regimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/israel-iran-bennett-netanyahu.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The last time I’d met with Naftali Bennett was at his home north of Tel Aviv not long after the attacks of Oct. 7 and just before Israel’s army went into Gaza. The former Israeli prime minister was worried about a blood bath. Bennett, whose short-lived term of office from 2021 to 2022 was notable for the ideological breadth of his government, sketched a four-part concept: Seize Gaza’s peripheries without trying to occupy its cities. Provide Gazans with food, water, medicine and safe havens but not the fuel that Hamas needs to operate its tunnels. Use an “ongoing and persistent series of targeted ground raids” to gradually degrade and destroy Hamas’s military over months or years. Offer safe passage out of Gaza for Hamas fighters willing to surrender, probably in exchange for the release of Israel’s hostages.

Benjamin Netanyahu ignored the advice. After 10 months of grinding war, Israel has achieved none of its major objectives. Hamas is not defeated. Its leader, Yahya Sinwar, is still at large and making demands. Tens of thousands of Israelis cannot return to their homes. The country is as divided as before and more isolated than ever.

What the Republican Party Might Look Like if Trump Loses,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/trump-republican-party-loss.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Donald Trump is behind in pivotal swing states and may soon join the ranks of two-time presidential losers. While it is early to predict the outcome of the upcoming election, Trump's declining electoral fortunes prompt a critical question: what happens to the Republican Party if he loses, especially if the loss is significant?

Historically, few figures have dominated a party without achieving a series of electoral victories. Unlike past leaders who reshaped their parties through consistent wins, Trump has led the Republican Party to a series of defeats since his 2016 victory. His presidency marked the first time since George H.W. Bush that a sitting president lost re-election, and candidates closely aligned with Trump have struggled in competitive races.

Moreover, Trump's leadership has resulted in a lack of coherent governance and a failure to maintain the party's ideological boundaries. His agenda is largely driven by personal biases rather than a structured platform, as evidenced by the absence of a formal Republican platform in 2020. This has allowed far-right extremism to seep into mainstream Republican politics, with some party members openly advocating violence against political opponents.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 20:55:52+0000

This book applies the frameworks of gambling to various fields, including politics and venture capital. 

In a recent conversation, Silver discussed Kamala Harris's chances in the upcoming election, noting that his model has her winning at around 52 percent.

A.I. Could Ruin Kids’ Critical-Thinking Skills,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/opinion/ai-schools-teachers-students.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Leila Wheless, a North Carolina teacher, has expressed concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on her students' critical-thinking skills. After assigning a research task related to the novel ""Persepolis,"" she found that students were producing absurd responses, such as confusing the biblical figure Moses with trivial facts. This reliance on A.I. tools has led to a lack of questioning and critical engagement among students, who no longer challenge unlikely information.

Educators across various levels have noted that while A.I. can assist with mundane tasks, its drawbacks are significant. The issue extends beyond cheating; it affects students' ability to think critically and persevere through challenging tasks. Sarah Martin, a high school English teacher in California, highlighted that students are increasingly inclined to give up when faced with difficulties, opting instead to seek quick solutions from A.I. or peers.

This trend raises concerns about the diminishing grit and resilience in students, as they are less likely to engage deeply with challenging concepts. The shift in student behavior over the years suggests a growing dependency on technology, which may ultimately undermine their intellectual development.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-14 13:00:35+0000

The Federal Reserve Must Be Independent. Here’s Why.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/federal-reserve-politics-independent.html,"This is an article by New York Times. On Saturday, Kamala Harris was asked to respond to Donald Trump’s suggestion that the president should have a say in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions. She was vehemently opposed, saying, “The Fed is an independent entity, and as president, I would never interfere in the decisions that the Fed makes.” Fed independence isn’t an issue that resonates with voters; most people probably don’t even understand the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy. But the likelihood that Trump, if he wins, will politicize the Fed looms large in the minds of those who analyze such things.

Historically, central banks like the Fed have often been treated like ordinary government agencies. Most wealthy nations and many with emerging economies have independent central banks and appoint relatively nonpartisan experts to run them. One reason for this independence is to avoid scenarios like Venezuela, where an irresponsible government relies on the printing press to pay its bills, leading to hyperinflation. Even beyond extreme scenarios, monetary policy is the easiest lever for governments to use and abuse, making it prudent to place control in the hands of quasi-independent technocrats to protect against temptation.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 18:34:21+0000
The Risks of Experimenting With the Sun,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/solar-geoengineering.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Your article about solar geoengineering raises serious concerns about a complex issue that demands diverse voices and rigorous scrutiny of the potential effects of these speculative interventions on climate, ecosystems, and human rights.

Claims that solar radiation modification, or S.R.M., could control the sun’s warming effects ignore the immense risks and the reality of sudden temperature spikes if deployment is stopped. This technology could never “restore” the climate but would further destabilize an already disturbed climate system, leading to unforeseen and irreversible ecological disasters, and severely affecting current and future generations.

Almost 500 leading scientists and more than 2,000 civil society organizations worldwide are calling for a solar geoengineering non-use agreement. Both African ministers and the European Parliament have called for such a mechanism, reflecting a growing consensus against these dangerous experiments.

It’s alarming that the key lesson learned from the Harvard solar geoengineering research project’s failure appears to be to proceed with less transparency, denying the public’s right to know about future experiments — while ignoring a global de facto moratorium of the United Nations on all geoengineering.

Solar geoengineering is no insurance to “buy time” to tackle the climate crisis. It is a recipe for disaster that distracts from the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 18:45:00+0000
What Should We Do About Google?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/google-antitrust-remedy.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A federal judge held last week that Google has a monopoly on online search and has been illegally defending that monopoly for years. The verdict is important and correct, yet it leaves open an important question: What should the remedy be? Judge Amit Mehta found that Google used a variety of means to hold on to its monopoly power and inflate prices paid by advertisers. The remedy needs to tear down the barriers that protect Google’s monopoly; if the judge delivers little more than a slap on the wrist, this historic victory for the Biden administration’s antitrust division will mean very little.

The government’s case centered on payments that Google pays Apple and others to be the default search engine on their products. If the court merely decrees that Google abandon those agreements, it won’t be enough to unlock a long-monopolized market. A truly effective remedy must seek not only to punish Google for its past offenses but also to open markets by meaningfully restraining the company from similar conduct in the future. The best way to do that is to ensure that a new generation of companies can compete fairly, especially in emerging markets for artificial-intelligence-driven tech services.

As a model to emulate, consider the remedies imposed on AT&T, which required the company to stay out of computing and to license all of its patents for free. That remedy gave rise to a new generation of companies that developed essential American industries.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 18:33:34+0000

How the Cass Report Became a Weapon in the War on Trans Kids,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/cass-report-trans-kids.html,"This is an article by New York Times. In its upcoming term, the Supreme Court will once again hear a case that involves a highly contentious question that lies at the heart of personal liberty: Who should decide what medical care a person receives? The case, United States v. Skrmetti, has been brought by the Biden administration to challenge a ban in Tennessee on gender-affirming care for adolescents that all major American medical organizations support. Tennessee is one of some two dozen states that have passed laws limiting gender-affirming care for young people. The appeal argues that these bans are an unconstitutional form of sex discrimination: They forbid long-used treatments for transgender adolescents that are also given to children who are not transgender for different reasons.

The Tennessee law, called the Protecting Children From Gender Mutilation Act, prohibits the use of puberty-blocking medications for transgender adolescents but permits them for children who go into puberty at an early age. It bans the use of sex hormones like testosterone in transgender adolescents but allows it for other health issues. Lawyers arguing in favor of these bans have taken a sharply different approach, asserting that the standard treatments for transgender children are not based in evidence and represent a grave risk to the health and well-being of young people. This argument has been floating around conservative circles in the United States for some time, and some European healthcare systems have embraced it too, limiting access to gender-affirming care for young people. The argument has been supercharged in recent months by an unlikely ally on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean: the British pediatrician Hilary Cass.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 20:56:55+0000

The West Clearly Doesn’t Want to Defeat Putin,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/russia-ukraine-west-war.html,"This is an article by New York Times. On July 9, as the world stared at the blood-splattered rubble of a children’s hospital in Kyiv, Russia celebrated its rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council with a lunch in New York. The incident is a perfect summation of the world we live in now. As the West watches on, seemingly impotent, Russia grows ever bolder, like a bully who realizes the teacher isn’t coming. Despite having the resources to end this war on Ukraine’s terms, the West clearly lacks the will to win. 

In the past two and a half years, Western leaders have reiterated that they “stand with Ukraine.” Yet despite saying the right words, those leaders continue to treat the war as a localized conflict in which they have few obligations. Promised military aid arrives late and in insufficient quantities to match Russia’s resources. Nor has the West managed to cut off the sources of Russia’s economic might, despite rounds of sanctions. 

This setup — an adversary with the will and resources to fight to the end and allies that deliver just enough aid to stop the front from collapsing tomorrow — leaves Ukraine in a bleak place. At a certain point, Ukrainian resolve will wear thin, and a peace deal with Mr. Putin, on whatever terms, will become preferable to dying.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 14:28:00+0000
Trump’s Big Lie About Harris’s Crowds,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/opinion/trump-crowds-kamala-harris.html,"This is an article by New York Times. When Donald Trump claims that Kamala Harris used A.I. to fake an image of a crowd greeting her, it reflects a mix of political calculation and narcissistic injury. He asserted on his Truth Social platform that there was no one at her plane and accused her of creating a false image of support. This claim is rooted in a conspiracy theory suggesting Harris deceived the public, which Trump argues is a form of election interference. 

Trump's rhetoric serves a dual purpose: it allows him to deny Harris's popularity while also preparing his supporters to reject election results if she wins. Many of his followers believe that crowd sizes correlate with electoral success, despite this being a flawed argument. This belief is reinforced by Trump's insistence that his movement represents a majority of Americans, despite evidence to the contrary. 

Ultimately, Trump's claims are not just about crowd sizes; they are part of a broader strategy to maintain his base's loyalty and justify their beliefs in the face of electoral defeat.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 18:04:42+0000

So why does Trump say that she is? Well, redbaiting, like race-baiting, is very much part of the American political tradition. It’s also true that American political discourse lacks a widely accepted term for people who support policies to limit economic inequality but don’t believe in government control of production. In European countries, politicians like Harris are known as social democrats. The thing is, social democracy isn’t a radical position; it has been the norm for generations in all wealthy nations. True, America’s social safety net is less comprehensive than those in Western Europe, but we still have significant programs like Social Security and Medicare.

Is Chaos the Key to Better Economics?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/opinion/chaos-theory-doyne-farmer.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The chaos theorist Doyne Farmer has led an eventful life, from beating casinos with a computer that predicted roulette outcomes to co-founding a quantitative trading firm. Now 72, he splits his time between Oxford University and his sloop, while actively working on new projects. Recently, he co-founded a company called Macrocosm, which applies chaos theory and complexity economics to tackle climate change and other complex issues. 

In his book, “Making Sense of Chaos: A Better Economics for a Better World,” Farmer critiques mainstream economic models that assume the economy tends toward equilibrium. He argues that many economic fluctuations arise from internal forces rather than external shocks, leading to a chaotic economic environment. Farmer defines chaos not as disorder but as a system characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions and endogenous motion, meaning the system is perpetually in flux due to its own dynamics. This perspective challenges traditional economic theories and suggests a need for a new understanding of economic behavior.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-12 19:00:02+0000

Current artificial intelligence technologies have become surprisingly good at creating realistic images and video, unleashing fears that fake images can be used for political and election manipulation. The key issue is that these images muddy the waters of credibility for everyone while providing a handy excuse for political operatives willing to lie to their supporters already eager to believe the lie.

Take Donald Trump’s recent social media post in which he accused Kamala Harris’s campaign of manipulating an image to make her crowd seem bigger. In today’s world, an average person can no longer be certain of the authenticity of images or videos through individual sleuthing. This makes it difficult to know what to believe, except through a key mechanism: trusting sources and trusting that they have either taken the image or video themselves or carefully vetted it as authentic.

We know that the crowd waiting for Harris was real because there are pictures from credible photo agencies and reports from multiple news organizations that match the circulating social media photos. It’s no accident that Trump has made it a habit to portray credible news organizations as untrustworthy liars, and many of his supporters seem to have internalized that message. Once trust is lost and all credibility is questioned, the lie doesn’t have to be high quality; it just needs a willing purveyor and an eager audience.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 15:39:08+0000
Registering Voters and Certifying the Votes,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/opinion/elections-voters.html,"This is an article by New York Times. As the founder and C.E.O. of The Civics Center, a national, nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to making voter registration part of every high school in America, I appreciated your bringing light to these issues. Making it harder to host registration drives disproportionately harms younger Americans. Our data show that less than one-third of 18-year-olds are currently registered to vote in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona, and New Hampshire.

If states keep adding hurdles to registering to vote, we’ll be stuck in a vicious cycle of youth alienation that can have devastating effects on our society. The good news is this can be fixed: by incorporating nonpartisan voter registration in schools and by passing legislation to designate high schools as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act. That requires states to actually want to solve this crisis.

For now, the best I can advise is for students to take this into their own hands and organize the most inclusive and dynamic registration drives they can for their schools as soon as they return from summer break. When back to school means ready to vote, we’ll have the kind of shift we need. 

However, such data are worrying only if one assumes that votes will be counted and certified, as in a normal election. Is it not a greater cause for concern if dozens of 2020 election deniers have been placed in positions of authority to certify the votes in swing states?",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-12 19:29:40+0000

I am curious about what is possible. Yes, democracy is still on the ballot. The crisis we are facing remains existential. But after almost two years of talking about Donald Trump’s extreme ideologies and Joe Biden’s age, we are participating in a substantive examination of a leader’s vision for America. We have a real opportunity to vote for someone rather than against the opposition.

Harris Should Take Divisions Over Gaza Seriously,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/opinion/harris-michigan-gaza.html,"This is an article by New York Times. For weeks, the signs did not look good for Kamala Harris in Michigan. Even in Detroit, usually friendly territory for Democrats, I bumped into haters. The leader of a well-to-do neighborhood association told me that the way Ms. Harris got nominated resembled “entrapment.” There was no sign of such skepticism at the Harris rally near the Detroit airport last Wednesday, where roughly 15,000 excited people waited hours to see her. Those comparisons are both inspiring and worrying. Inspiring because it does matter that such barriers are broken, and worrying because it can tempt Democrats to focus on style and symbolism over substance. This risk is most evident, and most significant, on the issue of Gaza. If the Harris campaign is unable to address this thorny issue in a way that feels like substance, then Democrats may not get the unity they’ll need to win in November.

The Opinion video above is the final episode in a series of three videos that take a stand against the death penalty in the United States. It features Charles Don Flores, who has been on death row in Texas since 1999, awaiting execution for a murder he insists he didn’t commit. The series lands at a hopeful but still challenging time in the movement to get rid of capital punishment in the United States.

The death penalty has gradually been falling out of favor with officials and the broader public alike over the past three decades, in part owing to what the Death Penalty Information Center called “society’s greater understanding about the fallibility of our legal system and its inability to protect innocent people from execution.” The number of states that have rejected capital punishment has increased steadily since the late 1990s. Twenty-nine states have now either abolished the death penalty or have paused executions by executive action, up from 12 states in 1999.

Last year, for the first time, a Gallup poll found that more Americans believe the death penalty is administered unfairly than fairly (50 percent versus 47 percent). And the percentage of people who support the death penalty has fallen steadily since the mid-1990s, according to Gallup, dropping to 53 percent this year, a five-decade low.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-12 19:42:01+0000

No politician wants to be the one to break the news that sooner than later, for the health of the planet, most of us are going to have to learn to eat a whole lot less meat — several times less red meat than what the average American consumes. This won’t be fixed by a few meatless Mondays. We have a deep fatalism about our diets, and the conventional wisdom says that the only way to persuade the carnivorous to eat less meat is to offer them a faux alternative, such as lab-grown meat or a vegan substitute like Beyond Meat.

However, no one is born loving hot dogs or disliking broccoli and Brazil nuts; our food preferences are learned. This fact carries with it a wonderful seed of hope for changing diets for the better by helping people learn new tastes. When it comes to food, pleasure is what changes the world, because few people make a habit of eating foods they dislike.

"‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ Is Rated R, but It’s Not for Grown-Ups",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/opinion/deadpool-wolverine-audience-rating.html,"This is an article by New York Times. By the end of this weekend, “Deadpool & Wolverine,” the latest film from Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, will likely have surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. This success would seem to be a win for audiences that want both big franchise movies and adult content. Unlike most of Disney’s superhero movies, which are carefully engineered to appeal to the widest possible commercial audience, the R-rated “Deadpool & Wolverine” is stuffed full of foul language, sex jokes, and gore. 

However, while the film is certainly not for kids, it’s difficult to argue that it’s truly for grown-ups either. The violence is relentless and mind-numbing, with the titular characters’ healing powers rendering them invulnerable, making the combat feel emotionally hollow. The film is filled with crude humor, yet lacks any real emotional stakes, as there is no actual sex depicted. Deadpool’s character, played by Ryan Reynolds, constantly reassures the audience that the film shouldn’t be taken seriously, reinforcing its nature as a big-budget franchise movie rooted in nostalgia and childishness.

This trend reflects a broader issue in Hollywood, where there seems to be an abandonment of entertainment made for adults. The cultural landscape has shifted to a point where there is no longer a clear divide between children’s and adult entertainment, leading to a consumption of media that lacks depth and maturity. This shift, while seemingly liberating, has contributed to the decline of grown-up entertainment in favor of profit-driven, simplistic content.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-12 17:56:31+0000

Kamala Harris has a very different theory of this election than Joe Biden did. In 2020, Biden ceded the battle for attention to Donald Trump, adopting a low-key campaigning style that allowed Trump to dominate the news cycle. This strategy worked for Biden when Trump was the unpopular incumbent, but in 2024, it was failing him as Biden became the unpopular incumbent. Biden's communication skills faltered, and some voters grew nostalgic for the Trump-era economy, shifting focus back to Biden's fitness for office.

With Harris's ascent as the Democratic nominee, she has been able to fight and win the battle for attention. Her campaign is playful, mocking, and confident, contrasting sharply with Biden's grave tone. Harris's strategy aims to make Trump appear smaller rather than larger, focusing on his weaknesses rather than his strengths.

Since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, I have watched all of candidate Harris’s public appearances for a sense of how she intends to run and possibly govern. What I took away: Harris is a different candidate from the one we saw four years ago. She is even a different rhetorician from six months ago.

Nominee Harris lands her applause lines. The former prosecutor is comfortable going on the attack. Her most consistent message is that Donald Trump wants to send America back to the Dark Ages. Unlike President Biden, she relishes calling Trump out by name. Authenticity is a mirage. Americans crave the performance of authenticity as a sign that our values are in safe hands — hands just like ours. Harris has an even more difficult task: She has to make the presidency look like a Black woman.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 20:27:05+0000
Katie Couric: Network Newscasts Need to Better Reflect America,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/opinion/katie-couric-network-anchors-women.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Norah O’Donnell recently announced that she will be stepping down as anchor of “CBS Evening News” after five years at the helm. I cheered Ms. O’Donnell as she carried out her duties with intelligence and grace, tackling topics that were especially important to women, such as sexual assault in the military, and prompting the Pentagon to institute wide-ranging reforms. The same week Ms. O’Donnell revealed her departure, the U.S. Women’s Gymnastics team excelled at the Paris Olympic Games, showcasing incredible athleticism and diversity that reflected America. This was also the first Olympics in history with equal representation of women and men competing. 

It was disappointing to read that Ms. O’Donnell would be replaced by two men, John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, leaving the big three networks with four male anchors. While I respect these journalists, the editorial decisions will still be dominated by three white men behind the scenes. This lack of diversity in leadership is concerning, especially during a campaign that could result in the election of the first woman president and first woman of color as president. Representation matters, and it is crucial for a diverse group of journalists to cover such historic stories.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-12 11:35:28+0000
Too Much of Our Seafood Has a Dark Secret,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/opinion/sustainable-seafood-sardines-anchovies.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Not that long ago, if you saw a piece of fish on your plate, you wouldn’t have thought to ask where it came from or whether it was sustainable. That began to change in the 1990s as conservation groups fought to protect all kinds of life in the ocean from overfishing. After persuading Congress to create and enforce strict plans to bring back species, they set in motion a virtuous cycle that made seafood, from the mighty swordfish to the humble sea scallop, abundant again. New rules for other species have had similarly positive effects, allowing sea turtles to escape shrimp nets and reducing seabird bycatch. However, up to 80 percent of the fish and shellfish on American plates are imported, often from companies accused of illegal fishing and forced labor. Wealthy nations unwittingly support these abuses by treating the world’s fish supply as a limitless resource, which is now dwindling. The global catch of fish peaked in the 1990s and has since declined steadily. Expanding fish farming was once seen as a solution, but it has not alleviated the pressure on wild fish stocks. Salmon and shrimp, popular farmed seafoods, are still fed wild fish caught in poorly regulated waters, wasting a significant amount of protein.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 20:09:15+0000
Where Does JD Vance’s Ideology Really Come From?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/opinion/jd-vance-right-wing-intellectual.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The single most troubling thing about Senator JD Vance is his close relationship with some of the most extreme elements of the American right. When asked to explain his worldview, Vance has cited his former boss, Peter Thiel, who has written passionately against democracy, and Curtis Yarvin, who believes the United States should transition to monarchy. Yarvin has also expressed favorable views on human bondage and questioned the benefits of apartheid for Black South Africans. 

While Vance’s admirers see him as a uniquely intellectual presence in American politics, his right-wing, authoritarian views are largely derivative of Thiel, Yarvin, and their community of “postliberal” ideologues. Vance has stated that the United States is in a period of Romanesque decline, suggesting that conservatives may need to adopt more radical approaches. This echoes Thiel’s belief that “liberalism” and “democracy” are “exhausted,” raising questions about Vance's fundamental hostility toward popular constitutional government.

In addition to his relationships with Thiel and Yarvin, Vance has been in contact with far-right figures, including Holocaust denier Chuck Johnson and alt-right provocateur Jack Posobiec. Vance's connections to these individuals highlight a troubling alignment with extremist ideologies that challenge the foundations of democracy.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-10 21:36:21+0000
Kamala Harris Is Speaking. Is She Listening?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/opinion/kamala-harris-gaza-detroit.html,"This is an article by New York Times. At a campaign rally in the Detroit area, Kamala Harris was interrupted by protesters shouting about Gaza. Her response, “I am speaking now,” reflected a stern political stance, prioritizing her message over the protesters' concerns. This moment echoed a similar incident from 1992 when Bill Clinton was confronted by an AIDS activist, highlighting a recurring theme in political discourse where urgent issues are sidelined for broader electoral strategies.

Before the rally, Harris had a brief meeting with pro-Palestinian activists, yet her rally remarks suggested a focus on defeating Trump rather than addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This approach, while politically calculated, seemed emotionally detached from the realities faced by Palestinian Americans, some of whom may have family in Gaza at risk of violence or starvation.

The article draws a parallel between the historical neglect of AIDS activism and the current disregard for the plight of those affected by the conflict in Gaza, suggesting that political leaders often prioritize broader electoral concerns over pressing humanitarian issues. The author reflects on the implications of such political calculus, questioning the moral responsibility of leaders to listen to marginalized voices amidst their campaign strategies.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-12 11:37:40+0000
My Travel Tips for Seeing the World’s Best Places,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/opinion/travel-vacation-world.html,"This is an article by New York Times. ’Tis the season for vacations, so let me make my pitch that the best travel is not lounging at a beach resort but rather journeying into a different world. We all need relaxation at times, but nothing beats the thrill of a trip of discovery and the education that comes with it. Mark Twain once observed that “travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness.” In that spirit, I’ve long urged young Americans to take gap years before college or junior years abroad. 

Still, there are risks, less of violence than of having your passport and credit cards stolen. So I preach both travel and prudence, and on a recent book tour, I found myself often asked about travel advice I had mentioned in my memoir. The most memorable travel often involves encountering something unfamiliar, so consider escaping the herds parading through Paris. Some of the places that you find most culturally distant may be right here in the United States. 

Be spontaneous. One occasionally hears that adventurous travel is just for men, but some of the most accomplished foreign correspondents and overseas photographers are women, as are a majority of Peace Corps volunteers.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-10 11:00:19+0000
"Trump, by the Numbers",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/opinion/trump-race-numbers-ratings.html,"This is an article by New York Times. As long as I’ve covered Republican campaigns, there has been racial fearmongering: Dark-skinned people are coming to hurt you. Be very afraid.

With Reagan, it was “welfare queens” glomming onto tax-free cash income. With George H.W. Bush, it was Willie Horton. Liberals would give more criminals like Horton furloughs, so they could break into your house and rape your girlfriend. With George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, it was Arab terrorists. Democrats would let them invade America and kill us. With Donald Trump, it was migrants swarming over the border from Central and South America with the intent to rape and kill, as well as the racist “birther” conspiracy about “Barack HUSSEIN Obama.”

Trump, who adopted his father’s view that some bloodlines are “superior” to others, has slipped into the usual Republican race-baiting by purposely fumbling Kamala Harris’s name, mispronouncing it different ways and christening her “Kamabla.” Speaking to a group of Black journalists recently, Trump stunningly questioned Harris’s racial identity, saying, “She was always of Indian heritage,” and adding, “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black.”",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-10 19:40:06+0000
There Is Still a Biden Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/opinion/joe-biden-president.html,"This is an article by New York Times. One of the Biden White House’s greatest achievements, from the perspective of its staffers, has been to deny the press the kind of juicy leaks that were constant under Donald Trump and frequent under his predecessors. Save for a very narrow period of time, that is, when there was a push to force an aging president toward the exits: Then and only then we got a drip-drip-drip of fascinating inside information.

For instance, we learned that Biden hadn’t held a full cabinet meeting since last October and that his handlers expected scripted questions from his cabinet officials. We learned that his capacities peak between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and diminish outside that six-hour window. We learned that congressional Democrats, liberal donors, and some journalists all had exposure to Biden’s decline that they didn’t discuss publicly until the debacle of the June debate. We learned that none other than Hunter Biden was acting as a close adviser to his father in the crucial days after that debate.

These are all interesting and pertinent facts about the man who officially leads the United States in a time of global danger. For a few weeks, the media coverage of the Biden White House built up the idea that there was a major scandal here, implicating the inner circle that encouraged the president to run for re-election and practiced deception amid his obvious decline. The potential scale of that scandal has diminished now that the country is no longer being asked to entrust the Oval Office to Biden for another four years.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-10 11:00:13+0000
My Mother’s Favorite Music Taught Me How to Live Courageously,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/opinion/juan-gabriel-mexican-culture-queer.html,"This is an article by New York Times. In the thick of the pandemic, I moved back to El Paso, Texas, where I’d been raised, for what I thought would be a temporary stay. I’d changed since I’d left; in New York and Boston, I had lived openly as a queer woman, but I found myself being more discreet around my family in El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. As soon as Covid restrictions eased, I began crossing the border into Ciudad Juárez to sing karaoke with my queer friends, often choosing songs by the iconic Mexican showman Juan Gabriel. Music has the power to help us understand ourselves, and Juan Gabriel’s tender femininity was a radical quality in a Mexico entrenched in machismo and homophobia.

I inherited my love for Juanga from my mother, who saw him as her first crush and ultimate hometown hero. On those nights in Juárez, I would wonder if my Mexican mother could accept him as he was, could she accept me, too? When I explain Juan Gabriel to American friends, I tell them to imagine an artist as revolutionary as Prince and as prolific as Elton John. His ability to make Latin Americans cry, laugh, and dance is unparalleled, and he managed to embody his Mexican roots while exuding queerness—two ideas that were for so long at odds in our culture.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-13 12:58:45+0000
Natural Birth and Breastfeeding:The Decisions That Women Face,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/opinion/natural-birth-breastfeeding.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Women still need C-sections. They have options for medication or no medication. They can breastfeed for two years or not breastfeed at all. They control their birth experience. That was not always the case, and it took a lot of fearless advocacy to make it happen.

To associate the natural birth movement with anti-vaxxers is a real disservice to the feminist pioneers who worked so hard to put women back in charge of childbirth. When I had my first child in the 1970s, my doctor tried to make me feel like a terrible mother because I wasn’t feeding my son puréed meat and vegetables at a month old. At the time, home births were virtually unheard of in the U.S., and in the hospital, while I managed to escape being put to sleep during labor, nothing like “natural childbirth” was available. My mother, 25 years earlier, had wanted to breastfeed but was talked out of it by her nurses and doctors.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-10 19:47:02+0000
Think You’ve Planned for Retirement? Beware the Tax Torpedo.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/opinion/retirement-tax-torpedo-social-security.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Look out for the Social Security tax torpedo. It may be heading toward the hull of your retirement accounts as we speak. And if it hits, you may not even realize it.

I’m in favor of taxing Social Security benefits, as the United States has done since 1983. But there is a problem with how it’s done. For middle-income taxpayers, different provisions of the tax code amplify one another. In certain circumstances, because of the tax torpedo and another twist nicknamed the capital gains bump zone, someone in the 12 percent tax bracket who takes a $1,000 retirement distribution could end up paying $499.50 in tax — for a marginal rate of nearly 50 percent.

There are ways to protect yourself from paying more tax than necessary, but they’re not simple. One of the people pointing out this problem is Wade Pfau, a retirement researcher who has a doctorate in economics from Princeton. In his “Retirement Planning Guidebook,” he calls the tax formula “loopy,” which he doesn’t mean as an insult.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-09 21:16:24+0000
How to Save Disney,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/opinion/disney-revitalize.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Let’s take a break from the drama of the 2024 election and talk about another empire dealing with turmoil: the Walt Disney Company, which is currently poised between cultural hegemony and internal decay. The hegemony is easy to see: successful movies like “Deadpool & Wolverine” and “Inside Out 2” show that Disney can still dominate the box office. However, the decay manifests in various ways, including culture-war controversies and a stagnant stock price, alongside significant layoffs.

The core issue can be summed up in a single sentence: the old stuff still sells, but nobody likes the new stuff. Disney's summer successes highlight its ability to profit from established franchises, but new content struggles to connect with audiences. Attempts to advance new Marvel storylines have faltered, and recent “Star Wars” shows have been met with mediocrity. Pixar's output has declined, with no standout kids' movie since “Moana” in 2016, and the recent film “Wish” failed to resonate culturally.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-09 18:53:07+0000
Trump’s Call to End Taxes on Social Security,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/opinion/trump-social-security-taxes.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Donald Trump’s latest campaign gambit, calling for an end to taxes on Social Security benefits, risks deepening a generational divide already evidenced by his indifference to man-made climate change and the more than $8 trillion added to the national debt during his term in office. This article cited an estimate of another $1.8 trillion added to the national debt over a decade if his proposal comes to pass. This does not include the impact of continuing the Trump-era tax cuts beyond their expiration date in 2025. The Brookings Institution estimated this would add another $2 trillion to the national debt by 2028.

Our children, grandchildren, and future generations will be left to deal with the devastating impacts of climate change and a government too overburdened by debt to meet many of its most fundamental obligations. Gorging on candy now will severely affect our future health. As a liberal, I’d support Donald Trump’s proposal to eliminate taxes on Social Security if he would pay for it by eliminating tax breaks for private equity investors, hedge fund managers, and other special interest groups that bought tax breaks from Congress, and by taxing the fossil fuel industry and other polluters. 

Also required would be funding the I.R.S. to collect more of the taxes owed. Since every dollar spent on collection brings in several dollars, it is irresponsible not to.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-09 19:25:56+0000
The Presidential Campaign’s Carbonated Détente,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/opinion/walz-vance-mountain-dew.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Anyone who has ever stood in line at a modern coffee shop and eavesdropped on fellow patrons’ painstakingly specific orders knows that the adage is wrong: We are not what we eat. We are what we drink. It’s how we intentionally brand ourselves, unintentionally reveal ourselves or some combination of the two. 

The beverage has had a starring role in the 2024 campaign because, it turns out, both vice-presidential candidates are fans of it. That suggests some artificially sweetened version of horseshoe theory, with left and right arriving at a similar destination, a carbonated détente. It also makes sense. The beverage enjoys special popularity in the middle of the country, where Senator JD Vance of Ohio and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota reside. 

Politicians and their potions — the subject could fill a tome, equal parts history, psychology, anthropology and gastronomy.

In late 2018, after an otherwise-normal Christmas holiday, Laurie Beatty started acting strange. An 81-year-old retired contractor, he grew unnaturally quiet and began poring over old accounting logs from a construction business he sold decades earlier, convinced that he had been bilked in the deal. Over the course of several days, Beatty slipped further into unreality, telling his wife the year was 1992 and wondering why his hair had turned white. He then started having seizures, and by the end of May, he was dead.

Doctors at the Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Center in Moncton identified an exceedingly rare condition — Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease — as the most likely culprit. However, when the post-mortem tests came back negative, the neurologist, Dr. Alier Marrero, informed Beatty’s children that something else was going on, but he didn’t know what it was. It turned out that Laurie Beatty was just one of many local residents exhibiting similar, inexplicable symptoms of neurological decline — more than 20 cases in the previous four years.

The Wonder Seasoning Your Salad Is Missing,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/magazine/everything-seasoning-crouton-salad-recipe.html,"This is an article by New York Times. When I was a kid, I was sure there was a “someone” who was an “everyone.” If a certain group of us was sitting around, someone might walk in and say, “Hey, where’s everyone?” If there was another group of the same size, that person might walk in and say, “Hey, everyone.” Who’s “everyone”? Who’s the one person whose presence means that nothing, or no one, is missing?

I was reminded of this recently when using a jar of everything seasoning. In London, we’re still a step or two behind New York in terms of bagels, but the popularity of a few recent bakeries made me think everyone knew what “everything” blend was. For those who don’t know, “everything” is actually well prescribed and rarely goes beyond five things: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, flaked sea salt, garlic or onion flakes or both. Back when bagel bakeries were really taking off in the 1970s and early 1980s in New York, these were each individual toppings. 

The idea to mix them all together — to have one bagel with “everything” on it — is claimed by a few different people, but the name most often cited is David Gussin’s. Around 1980, a young Gussin was at work, cleaning out the ovens at a bagel shop in Queens, N.Y. Rather than throwing away all the seasonings that had fallen to the bottom, he collected them and piled them all onto a bagel. The “everything” bagel — everything Gussin had, crucially, not “anything” that anyone cares to think of — was born.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:01:31+0000

An aging Democratic president who rose to prominence in the Senate announces his withdrawal from the race. The party is rived by ideological clashes and an anguishing war overseas. A notorious Republican rides a reactionary swell to threaten a Democratic winning streak. The parallels between 1968 and 2024 are uncanny. Joe Biden has become the first president since Lyndon B.

There will be protests in Chicago, just as there were in ’68, centered on Israel’s war in Gaza, which the left blames on Biden’s support for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

At a campaign rally in Georgia late last month, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about immigration, promising to revive a border-security bill that Donald Trump had previously killed. This bill was negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, including Senator James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma. Lankford, who has political ambitions and is running for Senate leadership, worked alongside Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Chris Murphy on this immigration bill, which represented a rare moment of bipartisanship in Congress. After receiving support from both party leaders and the White House, the bill seemed poised for success, potentially marking the first significant bipartisan immigration legislation in decades.

However, Trump opposed the bill, fearing it would provide Biden with a political victory during an election year. Despite the bill incorporating many hard-line policies favored by the right, it became politically toxic among Republicans, resulting in only four Republican senators voting in favor. Lankford's efforts ultimately fell short, leaving him to reflect on the challenges of achieving bipartisan cooperation in a party influenced by Trump.

JD Vance and the Restoration of the ‘New Right’,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/magazine/jd-vance-new-right-republicans.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Over the last few years, a loose coalition of conservative thinkers, journalists, publications, and think tanks have emerged under the banner of the New Right. With Senator JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, as its flag-bearer, this group has been hailed as the intellectual heft behind the MAGA movement and even as the future of American conservatism. Its very name declares a radical break with the Republican past. However, it is risky to ascribe coherence to a grouping like this, especially when its ranks range from the relatively buttoned-up Vance and his Senate colleague Josh Hawley to a ragtag assortment of self-described neo-monarchists, techno-libertarians, and right-wing Marxists.

At the heart of the New Right is a belief that most of what ails America can be blamed on a liberal elite that has burrowed into the federal government, the news media, Hollywood, big business, and higher education. The New Right posits a nationalistic nostalgia for a small-town America of decentralized government, where “good” jobs are available to all and faith is the cornerstone of society.

By the time I reached the hilltop over Kadugli in June, the war in Sudan had been raging for 1 year, 2 months and 7 days — more time than the war in Gaza, less than the one in Ukraine. Yet despite having killed many thousands of people and displacing millions more, this brutal civil war has remained nearly unknown to most of the world. Many NGOs no longer operate in the country. The United States Embassy fled to Ethiopia shortly after the fighting erupted. I arrived in Sudan with the help of a rebel group that controlled parts of the south. Armed men ushered me in over a muddy border road two weeks before without even a stamp in my passport.

We had now climbed the hilltop to a position the rebels had seized, a stony outcrop where a city of more than 100,000 people spread out across a lush African plain. Through a pair of binoculars, I could make out Kadugli’s residents beginning their day in what was still territory held by the government.

A Trust Would Give Me Big Bucks if I Had Children. I’m Concerned.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/magazine/trust-grandchildren-charity-ethics.html,"This is an article by New York Times. In a recent visit, my parents, both in their 70s, outlined their intentions for their considerable assets, which include a trust worth millions of dollars. They propose that my brother and I (both in our 30s) serve as trustees. We would receive an unconditional portion of the trust, with access to a majority share with conditions. My parents intend the trust to benefit “future generations,” in short, potential grandchildren. If there are no grandchildren (there are none currently; we’ve never discussed this topic), the trust is to be allocated for charitable purposes, particularly to support disadvantaged regional children, with my brother and me overseeing the disbursements.

This proposal has raised several ethical concerns for me. First, my parents’ wishes heavily favor individuals who may never come into existence. Are my parents right to value the interests of hypothetical future descendants against those of existing family members? Second, I worry about the potential for moral hazard.

"Who Are the S.P.L.M., the Rebel Group Fighting for Democracy in Sudan?",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/magazine/sudan-who-are-the-splm.html,"This is an article by New York Times. This summer, a rebel group fighting in Sudan gave permission to me and Moises Saman, a photographer, to see its enclave in the Nuba Mountains and to document its side of the country’s civil war. For two weeks we traveled mostly on quad bikes crossing muddy roads, savannas, and rocky hills to meet one of Africa’s most elusive insurgent organizations: the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North, known by the initials S.P.L.M.

This was a rare chance to see one of the front lines of the Sudanese war, which began in April 2023 when two generals in the capital, Khartoum, began vying for control of the country. Since then, many thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced in the fighting. Yet compared with the two conflicts that dominate the headlines now — those in Ukraine and Gaza — the Sudan civil war remains unknown to most readers.

The Nuba Mountains, a region in southern Sudan roughly the size of Ireland, remains one of the world’s most isolated places. Those who live there have long captured the imagination of outsiders. In recent years, the Nuba people have effectively broken off from Sudan, forming an enclave that runs its own schools, courts, and military. Those in charge are the S.P.L.M. rebels.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-08 15:24:12+0000
Judge John Hodgman on the Most Iconic Beatles Album Cover,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/magazine/judge-john-hodgman-on-the-most-iconic-beatles-album-cover.html,"This is an article by New York Times.

She said that’s ludicrous, and the White Album cover is easily more recognizable. I find that logic to be wild: It’s just a white cover!_

The correct answer is “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” So the real question is which one of you is more wrong. Your girlfriend is correct that Richard Hamilton’s blank, anti-Pepper design of “The Beatles”/The White Album is more important than John Kosh’s semi-pedestrian, high-school-yearbook layout for “Let It Be.” But Kosh’s _literally_ pedestrian cover for “Abbey Road” is probably one of the most known images in pop culture.

Stop Asking Celebrities to Sing Our National Anthem,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/magazine/celebrities-national-anthem.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The tradition of performing the national anthem at sporting events began during the 1918 World Series, where it was played by a military band in a moment of improvisation and patriotism. This spontaneous act resonated with the audience, leading to its repeated performance throughout the series and eventually becoming a staple at all World Series games. By 1931, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was officially designated as the national anthem, and advancements in technology allowed it to be sung at every professional baseball game.

Today, the anthem is a fixture at American sporting events, with celebrities often vying for the opportunity to perform it at high-profile occasions like the Super Bowl. However, this expectation places immense pressure on performers, as the song's challenging melody demands a high level of skill. While amateur singers are often forgiven for mistakes, pop stars are scrutinized for their performances, which are part of larger commercial spectacles.

This shift from a heartfelt expression of patriotism to a highly publicized event reflects a media culture that prioritizes novelty over tradition. The phenomenon of ""anthem fails"" has emerged, highlighting the challenges and expectations placed on those who sing the anthem in front of large audiences. Ultimately, the article argues that we should reconsider the practice of outsourcing our national pride to celebrities and instead embrace the anthem as a personal expression of love for the country.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-07 09:02:22+0000
Her Epilepsy Seemed to Be Managed Well … Until It Wasn’t,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/magazine/epilepsy-seizures-ictal-asystole.html,"This is an article by New York Times. More than a decade after her original diagnosis, a 33-year-old woman suddenly began experiencing episodes of losing consciousness. While making pizza with her friend Clare, she slurred her words and then became unresponsive, stiffening and falling to the floor. Clare, terrified, caught her and waited for her to regain consciousness, which she did after what felt like an eternity. The woman, who had previously experienced seizures characterized by déjà vu and a sense of impending doom, had always remained conscious during those episodes. 

Her first significant episode occurred while teaching a swimming class, prompting her to seek medical advice. An EEG revealed slower electrical activity in her temporal lobe, leading to a prescription for anti-seizure medication. Although she managed her condition for years, she experienced a sudden loss of consciousness two years prior while with her mother, which left doctors puzzled. A few months later, she collapsed at work, and security footage revealed her going limp before regaining consciousness. Alarmed, she contacted her neurologist, who increased her medication and referred her to the Epilepsy Clinic for further evaluation.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-07 09:02:08+0000
My Grandmother’s Tortillas Were the Best. Try Them Yourself.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/magazine/grandmothers-tortillas-recipe.html,"This is an article by New York Times. My grandmother’s comal was only about six inches in diameter. It was as central in her home, tucked behind pecan trees and loblolly pines heavy with Spanish moss in Live Oak, Fla., as the amber ashtrays and pickled hot peppers in Mason jars on her dining-room table. This house was full of “Hee Haw” and the Mandrell Sisters and Ray Charles and old dogs that smelled worse than they looked. It was also full of chili verde and carne adovada, homegrown chile de árbol, jalapeño and serranos for pickling or eating fresh with everything and my grandmother’s tortillas, fresh off her comal, the cast-iron griddle from which she flipped the most memorable food of my childhood.

In the Live Oak days, back in the early 1980s, I would watch as she warmed the stove and gathered her tools: the plastic bowl meant just for making tortillas, her rolling pin and the plate to rest the rolled dough. These flour tortillas were our daily bread, whipped up in a matter of moments. The kneading and shaping, rolling and shifting were moves she had been doing since she was tall enough to reach a countertop, about as big as I was when I would attach myself to her side and wait for my hot tortilla. In my memory, my Nana, Mary Gutierrez, wore a pair of baby blue polyester pants that hugged her hips, thick the way mine are now, her body full of life. Before she would start rolling the first tortilla, she would quickly touch the comal with her middle finger, to feel exactly how long she had before the temperature was correct.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-07 09:01:06+0000
How to Fall in Love With Baseball,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/magazine/radio-baseball-mets.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The hallmark of a great baseball radio announcer is knowing when to remain silent. That way, the game speaks for itself. Near home base, a pair of parabolic dishes relay the smack of a catcher’s glove, the scrape of spikes on dirt and chalk, the fizz of the crowd. A crack of the bat, caught by a shotgun mic poking out the window of the booth, announces a home run long before the ball drops into the stands. When you listen to baseball on the radio, you learn that there can be beauty in redaction, in going by only what you’re given.

The late, legendary Vin Scully, who called games for the Dodgers, renders the final inning of Sandy Koufax’s 1965 perfect game immortal via restraint. He describes Koufax taking the mound — “the loneliest place in the world” — with “29,000 people in the ballpark and a million butterflies” surrounding him. My grandmother listened to Scully call the Brooklyn Dodgers before they broke her heart and moved West in 1958. She approached baseball fandom with fervent devotion, adopting the Mets when they joined the league in 1962. I was born into her fandom, watching games on television with my father, but I felt impatient, not liking being glued to a front-row seat.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-06 09:02:45+0000
Artists and Activists Both Have a Role. But Not the Same One.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/magazine/activism-propaganda-artists-writers.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Two decades ago, I was a public-affairs officer in the Marine Corps, tasked with “telling the Marine Corps story” and providing accurate information about military operations to maintain the trust of the American people. We weren’t propagandists — we told the truth, and in Iraq we welcomed plenty of embedded reporters who we knew would write extremely skeptical articles on the progress of the war — but there were fairly tight borders around what the military thought the American people needed to know.

Coming back from Iraq in 2008, though, I had a set of stories that didn’t fit perfectly with the official one I had a license to tell. Some were things I’d seen, things I could report on in a journalistic way, sure of the facts, but others were things I’d heard, stories that I couldn’t vouch for personally but that, passed to me by word of mouth and preserved in my memory, nevertheless seemed to express something true and unsettling.

One was told to me by a young combat correspondent, a Marine whose job in the corps was writing articles and making videos about the work we were doing. He had been in Ramadi when a suicide bomber detonated among a crowd of civilians, killing and grievously wounding dozens. The local unit took the injured to the Ramadi combat hospital, where Navy doctors, nurses and corpsmen got to work as Marines lined up to donate blood. 

Horrible slaughter in a region of Iraq where violence has spiraled out of control does not make for a good news story, but there were messages the Marine Corps was happy to put out: that unlike our barbaric enemy, who brutally murdered men, women and children, we cared about Iraqi civilians and would work tirelessly to save lives.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-05 09:03:35+0000
The Willful Amnesia Behind Trump’s Attacks on Kamala Harris’s Identity,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/magazine/kamala-harris-black-identity-history.html,"This is an article by New York Times. When I was a child, my dad sat my older sister and me down in our living room and explained to us the rules of race in America. A Black man born into a Mississippi where Black boys could be lynched for merely standing too close to a white woman, he met my white mom in 1972. In other words, Dad held no illusions about how race worked in our society and felt it was his duty as a parent to prepare us. Our mother might be white, he told us, but in this country, that fact was irrelevant to how we would be seen and treated. I grew up surrounded by aunts, uncles, cousins and my grandmama from my dad’s side as just another child in a big Black family. I cannot say exactly how I knew I was Black before my dad sat us down, but I knew. Last week, former President Donald J. Trump told a room full of Black journalists that Vice President Kamala Harris “was always of Indian heritage” and “now wants to be known as Black.” By suggesting that there was something nefarious or politically contrived about a mixed-race person claiming Blackness as her identity, he was acting as if that choice hadn’t been made for Harris when she was born to a Black father. It seems that when a mixed-race Black American appears to be ascending to the pinnacles of American power, some white Americans suddenly forget the race rules that white society created.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-06 17:28:00+0000
‘The Interview’: Vince Vaughn Turned This Interview Into Self-Help,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/magazine/vince-vaughn-interview.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The Vince Vaughn who lives in my head is one of my favorite comedic actors. He’s the swaggering, charmingly sarcastic and cheerily ingratiating star of that great run of hit comedies from the early 2000s. In more recent years, though, after the often R-rated, kind of bro-y comedies with which Vaughn made his mark lost some of their cultural mojo, he has focused more on dramatic roles. But as good as Vaughn can be with darker characters, I never connected those parts to the man who played them. Instead, I found someone more provocative and earnest, who came most alive when he put me under the conversational microscope. 

When discussing R-rated comedies, Vaughn noted that Hollywood executives follow a set of rules aimed at avoiding risk. The R comedies that took off were the result of studios allowing young, funny people to take creative risks without micromanagement. However, he believes that the current approach has become overly controlled, stifling the spontaneity that made those films successful.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-08 02:51:18+0000
Was I Wrong to Reveal That My Novel Was Inspired by an Adulterous Friend?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/magazine/novel-adulterous-friend-ethics.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Two decades ago, while raising a child in a small town, my husband and I became close to two other families with children the same age as ours. We socialized frequently, both on and off the playground. Then it came to light that, for more than a year, one of the husbands had been having an affair with the wife of the other, and our chummy sextuplet was torn asunder. Initially, both couples managed to stay together, but the deceived wife made it clear to my husband and me that we would have to choose with whom to stay friends. I picked the cheating wife, who confided in me that the reason the husband initiated the affair was that his wife hated sex. 

We ended up moving away, but eventually I wrote a novel that drew on the episode. To promote it, I published an essay in a small writerly newsletter about what inspired the plot, disguising the names of those involved. Unfortunately, someone who still lives in the town read the essay and passed it around until it made its way to my old friend — the wife who cheated. She immediately emailed me and demanded I delete the essay from all social media, stating she would no longer consider me a friend if I didn’t make the newsletter remove it from its website. I pointed out that the affair happened long ago and that she needs to move on, but she feels that I have gravely wronged her.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-02 19:00:03+0000
How the World’s Oldest Humpback Whale Has Survived Is a Mystery,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/science/oldest-humpack-whale-old-timer.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Old Timer, a male humpback whale first photographed in 1972, was spotted last month near Alaska, enduring in the Pacific Ocean while some other humpbacks have struggled in a changing environment. The tail of Old Timer, mostly black with white speckles, is unique, much like a fingerprint. Adam A. Pack, a marine mammal researcher, recognized the flukes of Old Timer during a recent photography session in Frederick Sound, Alaska. At over 53 years old, Old Timer is now considered the oldest known humpback whale in the world.

Humpback whale populations have rebounded in recent decades after being severely depleted by commercial whaling, but they still face threats from ship strikes, entanglements in fishing gear, and climate change. Dr. Pack had previously worried about Old Timer's survival, especially after witnessing the impact of a record-breaking heat wave in 2015 that led to the deaths of many marine mammals. However, seeing Old Timer again after nine years was heartwarming for Dr. Pack, who noted that some whales are resilient.

Future studies of Old Timer and other humpbacks will be enhanced by artificial intelligence, which Dr. Pack hopes will provide insights into how and why some whales can withstand tough conditions.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:02:33+0000
Saving Australian Crocodiles by Yucking Their Yum,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/science/crocodiles-cane-toads-bait-australia.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Researchers in Australia are using a novel approach to protect freshwater crocodiles from the toxic cane toads that have become a significant threat to their populations. By injecting toad carcasses with a nonlethal chemical that induces nausea, scientists aim to alter the crocodiles' eating behavior. This method, known as conditioned taste aversion, is designed to train the crocodiles to avoid the toxic toads, which have led to a dramatic decline in their numbers—over 70% in some areas.

Cane toads were introduced to Australia in 1935 to control pests in sugar cane crops but quickly became invasive themselves. They secrete lethal toxins when threatened, making them dangerous for native predators like crocodiles. Traditional eradication efforts have failed, prompting conservationists to explore alternative strategies to help wildlife coexist with these invaders.

Dr. Georgia Ward-Fear, a conservation ecologist, emphasizes the importance of adapting to the presence of cane toads rather than attempting to eliminate them. The research, published in the journal *Proceedings of the Royal Society B*, suggests that this innovative approach could be key to saving crocodile populations from further decline.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 23:01:06+0000
I Am the Walrus but This Fossil Was Not,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/science/walrus-fossil.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Some 2 million years ago, a large mammal swimming through the North Atlantic Ocean hauled its bulk up onto a beach, its belly full of clams. It had blubber, tusks, and more than likely, whiskers. In fact, the extinct animal was a member of a different marine mammal genus entirely, as different from a modern walrus as a fox is from your dog. Researchers say this relative of the walrus may have used a very similar foraging strategy: suction feeding.

Mathieu Boisville, a paleontologist at the University of Tsukuba in Japan, noted that it’s rare for two large animals to develop such similar adaptations, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. The false walrus, named Ontocetus posti, belongs to a group of marine mammals that first appeared around five million years ago on the Pacific Coast of North America. Most remains from this group are found around the southeastern shores of the United States. However, over several decades, fossils were found along the coasts and seabed of the North Sea, not far from regions around Antwerp in Belgium and Norwich in England.

Initially classified as a separate species, Ontocetus emmonsi, Dr. Boisville’s team found that the jaws of Ontocetus posti were more walrus-like than those of their southern relatives. Like its close kin, it had a complement of teeth, including lower incisors and a large lower canine, but its heavy chin bones were fused, similar to those of a modern walrus.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-14 13:42:51+0000
Salmon Farms in Patagonia Face Growing Opposition,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/science/chile-salmon-farms-patagonia.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The Chilean industry’s expansion has drawn repeated challenges from environmentalists and Indigenous people of the region, prompting calls for a moratorium. The sea is calm as dusk descends on Tarsicio Antezana’s home island of Quinchao in southern Chile. In the distance, snow-capped volcanoes turn a deep violet with the setting sun. However, Mr. Antezana, a retired oceanographer, cannot ignore the strip of small, rectangular objects in the water, which are salmon farms.

Below the water, high-density net cages teem with thousands of salmon. Farms like this one are common in Los Lagos, the primary aquaculture region in Chile. The South American country is the top exporter of farmed salmon to the United States, but the popular fish are not native to this place. Many environmentalists and activists have long complained that the farms are damaging Chilean ecosystems and threatening native wildlife.

Large-scale salmon farming began in Chile in the 1970s, and Mr. Antezana was asked to evaluate the viability of farming the fish. He advised the government to establish baseline studies and to be wary of ecological and health risks. Over four decades, he has watched the industry grow into one of the world’s leading producers of farmed salmon, generating $6.5 billion in revenue last year.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 07:00:29+0000
Ship Brings Clues in Mantle to Life’s Origins Up From Ocean’s ‘Lost City’,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/science/mantle-core-drill-ocean.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Scientists in an expedition to the Mid-Atlantic ocean ridge lifted almost a mile of precious rocks from beneath an exotic feature linked to life’s possible beginning. In the “Lost City” complex, researchers proposed that the life-preceding chemistry may have churned beneath a jagged landscape of eerie spires. For the first time, specialists have succeeded in getting a glimpse of this potential Garden of Eden.

A report in the journal Science details a 30-person team drilling deep into the Mid-Atlantic seabed and pulling up nearly a mile of extremely rare rocky material. This sample is significant for a major theory on the origin of life. “We did it,” said Frieder Klein, an expedition team member. “We now have a treasure trove of rocks that will let us systematically study the processes that people believe are relevant to the emergence of life on the planet.”

The drilled region sits alongside one of the volcanic rifts that crisscross the global seabed. Known as midocean ridges, these sites feature hot springs that shed minerals into the seawater, building up strange mounds and spires that host bizarre creatures.

NEOWISE, a spacecraft that studied faraway cosmic objects before shifting its focus closer to home, has reached the end of its life. This final image captured by NASA’s NEOWISE shows part of the Fornax constellation in the Southern Hemisphere. It was the mission’s 26,886,704th exposure. The image itself is not particularly exciting, but it represented the last light of NEOWISE, a telescope that spent more than a decade scrutinizing the skies for asteroids and comets that could pose a threat to Earth. At the end of last month, the spacecraft’s survey concluded, and it closed its telescopic eyes for the final time.

“This was the little space telescope that could,” said Amy Mainzer, an astronomer at UCLA and principal investigator for NEOWISE. When the mission was launched in 2009, it was known simply as WISE, initially focusing on faraway objects radiating infrared light. Scientists later realized it was effective at detecting asteroids, leading to significant discoveries, including the first asteroid to share an orbit with Earth. After its original survey, the mission was extended with a focus on asteroid detection, rebranded as NEOWISE, until its systems were put into hibernation in 2011.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-09 20:49:39+0000

Scientists decided to map the remote aquatic ecosystems around Kangaroo Island and Olive Island in Australia by attaching video cameras to local sea lions, which routinely dive 300 feet beneath the surface while hunting. This initiative was led by Nathan Angelakis, a Ph.D. student at the South Australian Research and Development Institute and the University of Adelaide. The sea lions, named Daphne, Phoebe, Iris, and Pasithea, provided footage of previously unseen areas of the ocean floor, revealing meadows of seaweeds and coral-covered rocks, including a rare recording of a mother sea lion teaching her pup to hunt.

The research team hopes that the findings will enhance understanding of how sea lions utilize different habitats and inform conservation efforts for these endangered animals. Traditionally, seabed mapping relies on remotely operated vehicles and towed cameras, which can be costly and challenging. By using sea lions equipped with cameras, the researchers aimed to explore these ecosystems more effectively. 

With approval from marine conservation authorities, the team sedated the sea lions lightly to attach the cameras and tracking devices.

New fossils from Indonesia, including the smallest humerus ever found from an adult hominin, belonged to the tiny Homo floresiensis species, researchers said. A new study describes 700,000-year-old teeth and arm bones from a toddler-size “hobbit” who lived on a small island between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests that Homo floresiensis could be even smaller than previously thought, but results left scientists divided over how such exceptional humans evolved.

The hobbits were first discovered 20 years ago inside the Liang Bua cave on the Indonesian island of Flores. Australian and Indonesian scientists uncovered bones and teeth, along with stone tools likely used to butcher meat. Based on those bones, researchers estimated that Homo floresiensis stood about three and a half feet tall, with a brain about one-third the size of a modern human’s.

Extreme rainfall made 10 percent heavier by human-caused climate change triggered landslides that killed hundreds, according to a new study. A sudden burst of rainfall on July 30 caused a cascade of landslides that buried hundreds of people in the mountainous Kerala region of southern India. That downpour was 10 percent heavier because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by World Weather Attribution. Nearly six inches, or 150 millimeters, of rain fell on soils already highly saturated from two months of monsoon and marked the third highest single-day rain event on record for India.

“The devastation in northern Kerala is concerning not only because of the difficult humanitarian situation faced by thousands today, but also because this disaster occurred in a continually warming world,” said Maja Vahlberg, a climate risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. As of Tuesday, at least 231 people had died and 100 remained missing. The Kerala landslides were the second extreme landslide event in July, following one in Ethiopia that killed 257 people. 

July was the second-worst month on record, with 95 landslide events that caused 1,167 fatalities, according to data maintained by Dave Petley, the vice-chancellor of the University of Hull.

How to Protect Your Mail-Order Prescriptions From Extreme Heat,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/health/protect-drug-mail-prescriptions.html,"This is an article by New York Times. High temperatures and humidity can alter the components in many home-delivery medications, rendering them less effective. Temperature and humidity levels can affect drugs all year round, but the likelihood of a problem is highest during the summer. Whether you are enrolled in a mail-order pharmacy program or are ordering over-the-counter pills from Amazon, it’s important to consider how compounds could be affected on their way to your doorstep.

For many oral medications, the United States Pharmacopeia recommends keeping medications at temperatures of 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit. It allows for an expanded temperature range of 59 to 86 degrees to accommodate for mild “excursions,” as long as the average temperature does not exceed 77 degrees. Most mail-order pharmacies say that their packaging is weather resistant, but research has shown that packages sometimes spend more than two-thirds of transit time outside the appropriate temperature range.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 15:42:05+0000
Hot Summer Threatens Efficacy of Mail-Order Medications,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/health/heat-mail-order-drugs.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The temperatures inside delivery trucks can reach twice the recommended threshold, but federal rules on drug storage conditions do not apply to the booming world of mail-order delivery. Toujeo, a medication used to treat Type 2 diabetes, is intended to be stored at temperatures below 86 degrees. However, many patients receive their doses through the mail, even in the summer heat. Melted capsules, cloudy insulin, and pills that may no longer work are concerns raised by doctors and pharmacists regarding the impact of scorching temperatures on medications.

Millions of Americans now receive their prescription medications through mail-order shipments, either for convenience or because their health plans require it. The temperatures inside the cargo areas of delivery trucks can reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, far exceeding the recommended range of 68 to 77 degrees. Mail-order pharmacies claim their packaging is weather resistant and that they take special precautions for medications requiring specific temperature control. However, a study found that packages spent more than two-thirds of their transit time outside the appropriate temperature range.

Extreme temperatures can alter the components in many medications, including insulin and oral contraceptives. Liquid medications are particularly at risk of degradation due to excessive heat exposure, which can cause the evaporation of liquid components.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 19:06:05+0000
When ‘Abortion’ Wasn’t a Dirty Word,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/science/medical-history-abortion.html,"This is an article by New York Times. One morning in 2012, eight weeks into her pregnancy, Shannon Withycombe woke up bleeding: She was having a miscarriage. In the emergency room, however, no doctor or nurse uttered that word. Instead, she had to wait to read her discharge papers, which read “incomplete abortion.” Dr. Withycombe, a medical historian at the University of New Mexico, knew the term from her research on 19th-century medical journals; it was doctorspeak for a miscarriage that had not fully exited the uterus. But it was jarring to see it on her own 21st-century medical notes.

Physiologically, miscarriage and medication abortion are near-identical experiences. Both start with a decrease in the hormones that maintain pregnancy, followed by vaginal bleeding, and then the uterus squeezes like a fist to push out the tissues of pregnancy. Both are managed with the same tools and medications, which is why laws that restrict abortion care also affect women who miscarry. In the 21st-century United States, of course, the distinction matters. Dr. Withycombe’s odd-sounding diagnosis is a relic of a time when the word “abortion” had none of the legal, moral or political connotations that it does today. In medical circles during the 1800s, “abortion” was the preferred term for any form of early pregnancy loss, used interchangeably with the more colloquial “miscarriage.”",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 07:00:06+0000
"Older Adults Do Not Benefit From Moderate Drinking, Large Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/health/alcohol-cancer-heart-disease.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Even light drinking was associated with an increase in cancer deaths among older adults in Britain, researchers reported on Monday in a large study. The study tracked 135,103 adults aged 60 and older for 12 years and found that the risk was accentuated primarily in those with existing health problems or who lived in low-income areas. It also challenged the long-held belief that light or moderate alcohol consumption is beneficial for heart health, as no reduction in heart disease deaths was found among light or moderate drinkers compared to occasional drinkers.

The study defined light drinking as a mean alcohol intake of up to 20 grams a day for men and up to 10 grams daily for women. Dr. Rosario Ortolá, the lead author of the paper published in JAMA Network Open, stated, “We did not find evidence of a beneficial association between low drinking and mortality.” She added that alcohol likely raises the risk of cancer “from the first drop.” 

These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that is shifting the paradigm in alcohol research, as scientists are now employing new methodologies to analyze the risks and benefits of alcohol consumption.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-12 16:57:40+0000
"Heat Contributed to 47,000 Deaths in Europe Last Year, but Relief Programs Helped",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/climate/excess-heat-deaths-europe.html,"This is an article by New York Times. More than 47,000 Europeans died from heat-related causes during 2023, the world’s hottest year on record, a new report in Nature Medicine has found. But the number could have been much higher. Without heat adaptation measures over the past two decades, the death toll for Europeans experiencing the same temperatures at the start of the 21st century could have been 80 percent higher. For people over 80 years old, the toll could have doubled.

Some of the measures include advances in health care, more widespread air-conditioning, and improved public information that kept people indoors and hydrated amid extreme temperatures. “We need to consider climate change as a health issue,” said Elisa Gallo, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. “We still have thousands of deaths caused by heat every year, so we still have to work a lot and we have to work faster.”

Counting deaths from extreme heat is difficult, in part because death certificates don’t always reflect the role of heat.

I.V.F. Threats in Alabama Drive Clinics to Ship Out Embryos,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/health/ivf-embryos-alabama.html,"This is an article by New York Times. An emerging movement against in vitro fertilization is driving some doctors and patients in red states to move or destroy frozen embryos. The embryo migration is most striking in Alabama, where the State Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos were “unborn children.” Since then, at least four of Alabama’s seven fertility clinics have hired biotech companies to move the cells elsewhere. A fifth clinic is working with a doctor in New York to discard embryos because of concerns about the legality of doing so in Alabama.

Fertility patients outside of Alabama are also worried about how their embryos might be affected by lawmakers who believe human life begins at conception. Since the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, 14 states have passed total or near-total abortion bans. The Southern Baptists, the country’s largest Protestant denomination, voted in June to oppose I.V.F., calling for the protection of “frozen embryonic human beings.”

In Texas, Diana Zucknick spent $1,550 to send a tank of liquid nitrogen holding five of her embryos to New York for safekeeping. In South Dakota, Jennifer Zabel destroyed two embryos due to fears that the state would take control of them. Meanwhile, Dr. Preston Parry in Mississippi noted that more of his fertility patients are choosing to make fewer embryos at a time, prolonging the typical I.V.F. process to minimize leftover embryos.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-12 09:00:59+0000
An Australian Start-Up Hopes to Slow Climate Change With an Unusual Approach,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/climate/climate-change-fungus-carbon-australia.html,"This is an article by New York Times. An Australian start-up is hoping fungi can pull carbon dioxide from the air and stash it underground. It’s part of a big bet that entrepreneurs and investors around the world are making on whether dirt can clean up climate pollution. Farmers are trying to tap the superpowers of tiny subterranean tendrils of fungus to pull carbon dioxide out of the air and stash it underground. 

Why fungus? Because fungi act as nature’s carbon traders. As they sow their crops, farmers are adding a pulverized dust of fungal spores. The fungus latches on to the crop roots, takes carbon that is absorbed by the plants from the air, and locks it away in subterranean storage in a form that may keep it underground for much longer than the natural carbon cycle. 

The fungal venture, the handiwork of an Australian company called Loam Bio, is among several start-ups to have mobilized hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in efforts to use soil to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The appeal of the Australian start-up is that it doesn’t demand too much of farmers.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 21:45:36+0000
"FDA Declines to Approve MDMA Therapy, and Seeks Further Study",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/fda-mdma-ptsd-delay.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday declined to approve MDMA-assisted therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, dealing a serious blow to the nascent field of psychedelic medicine and dashing the hopes of many Americans who are desperate for new treatments. The F.D.A. said there was insufficient data to allow its use, and it asked the company seeking approval for the treatment, Lykos Therapeutics, to conduct an additional clinical trial to assess whether the drug, commonly known as Ecstasy or molly, would be safe and effective.

An additional clinical trial could add years, and millions of dollars, to the approval process. If approved, MDMA would have become the first psychedelic compound to be regulated by federal health authorities. Supporters of psychedelic medicine were deeply disappointed, and some said they were stunned, having assumed the therapy’s promising data would overcome flaws in the company’s clinical trials, which had been designed in consultation with F.D.A. scientists.

“This is an earthquake for those in the field who thought F.D.A. approval would be a cinch,” said Michael Pollan, the best-selling author and co-founder of the UC Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics. But the agency’s decision had not been entirely unexpected, after a group of independent experts convened by the F.D.A. to evaluate Lykos’s data met in June and did not recommend the treatment. On two central questions, the experts voted overwhelmingly that the company had not proven the treatment was effective, and that the drug therapy’s benefits did not outweigh the risks.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-10 11:56:53+0000
"J. Robin Warren, Who Proved That Bacteria Cause Ulcers, Dies at 87",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/j-robin-warren-dead.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Dr. J. Robin Warren, an Australian pathologist who shared a Nobel Prize for discovering that most stomach ulcers were caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, died on July 23 in Inglewood, Australia, at the age of 87. His death was announced by the University of Western Australia, where he served as an emeritus professor. Dr. Warren's research challenged the long-held belief that stress, alcohol, or spicy foods were the primary causes of ulcers.

In 1984, he and gastroenterologist Barry Marshall published a groundbreaking paper in The Lancet, revealing that H. pylori thrived in the stomachs of patients with ulcers and gastritis. This finding overturned centuries of medical understanding, which had led to treatments focused on stress reduction and dietary changes. Initially, their study faced skepticism from the medical community, as the notion that bacteria could survive in the acidic environment of the stomach was considered radical.

Despite the doubts, their work eventually transformed the treatment of ulcers, leading to the use of antibiotics and other therapies targeting H. pylori. Dr. Warren's contributions to medicine have had a lasting impact on gastrointestinal health and treatment practices.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-09 22:15:26+0000
Childhood Vaccines Aren’t Just Saving Lives. They’re Saving Money.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/childhood-vaccines.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Over the past three decades, routine immunizations have prevented 1.1 million deaths and saved the United States $540 billion, the C.D.C. estimated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that routine childhood vaccinations prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1,129,000 deaths from 1994 to 2023. 

There’s no way to put a price on the pain and suffering prevented by childhood vaccines. But as it turns out, you can pinpoint the savings to the country. For nearly three decades, childhood vaccines — including those that target measles, tetanus, and diphtheria — have saved the United States $540 billion in health care costs, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

“These vaccine programs, when you create the right infrastructure to implement them, they pay for themselves right away,” said William Padula, a health economist at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the new research. The savings estimate includes money that would have been spent on treating the initial infection and managing later, related conditions. But vaccine-preventable illnesses can also cause indirect economic effects if children become permanently disabled from an infection, or parents miss work while caring for their sick children.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-12 18:36:27+0000

Warm summer nights and swift colorful streaks make the Perseids meteor shower a crowd favorite, but this year, observers may have to compete with light from the moon. The Perseids have been active since mid-July and are forecast to continue until the end of August, peaking on August 11 to 12, or Sunday night into Monday morning.

Meteor showers are natural fireworks that streak brightly across the night sky, and the Perseids are one of the strongest shows each year, with as many as 100 long, colorful streaks an hour. They are best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, just before dawn. This year, the nearly half-full moon will set before midnight, leaving the early morning hours sufficiently dark for a spectacular show.

"About 400 Million People Worldwide Have Had Long Covid, Researchers Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html,"This is an article by New York Times. About 400 million people worldwide have been afflicted with long Covid, according to a new report by scientists and researchers. The economic cost of this condition is estimated to be about $1 trillion annually, which represents approximately 1 percent of the global economy. The report, published in the journal Nature Medicine, summarizes the knowledge and effects of long Covid four years after it first emerged and aims to provide a roadmap for policy and research priorities.

The authors evaluated numerous studies and estimated that about 6 percent of adults and 1 percent of children have experienced long Covid since the pandemic began. They noted that the actual number might be higher, as their estimate only includes those who developed long Covid after showing symptoms during the infectious stage of the virus. Many individuals have not fully recovered, with studies suggesting that only 7 to 10 percent of long Covid patients fully recover two years after developing the condition.

The consequences of long Covid are significant, affecting patients' well-being, ability to work, and social interactions. Estimates indicate that between two million and four million adults were out of work due to long Covid in 2022, and those with the condition were 10 percent less likely to be employed compared to those who were never infected. Long Covid patients often have to reduce their work hours, with one in four limiting activities outside of work to continue their employment.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-09 13:29:02+0000
What Happens if You Stop Ozempic or Other Weight Loss Drugs After Losing Weight?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Many patients are eager to discontinue Wegovy or Zepbound when their weight loss plateaus. But doctors say it’s difficult to go cold turkey. Susana Parks was delighted when she lost 40 pounds on Eli Lilly’s obesity drug, Zepbound. However, now that she is at her goal weight, she has questions about how to maintain her weight loss if she stops taking the drug. 

These questions are becoming common, obesity medicine specialists say, as more people lose weight with obesity drugs. Some struggle to pay for the medicine, have difficulty finding it, or just don’t want to stay on a drug longer than they believe they need to. Dr. David Cummings, a weight-loss specialist at the University of Washington, explains that studies show that when people stop taking the drugs, their weight rapidly returns.

NOAA Forecasts Highly Active Hurricane Season Will Continue,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/climate/noaa-hurricane-forecast.html,"This is an article by New York Times. This year’s hurricane season could rank among the busiest on record, according to an update from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The biggest factors are abnormally high sea surface temperatures and the expected emergence of La Niña in the equatorial Pacific, which could increase hurricane activity in the Atlantic. NOAA’s new forecast predicts that as many as 24 named tropical storms, with wind speeds of 39 miles per hour or greater, could form between June 1 and Nov. 30. At least eight of these storms could become hurricanes, and up to seven could become major hurricanes, which is an increase from a typical season in the Atlantic.

“The hurricane season got off to an early and violent start with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record,” said Rick Spinrad, the administrator of NOAA. Hurricane season hasn’t reached its peak yet, but it’s just around the corner, Dr. Spinrad added, and the most significant effects from hurricanes and tropical storms in the United States could be yet to come. The National Weather Service urged people to know their risks, prepare for hurricane-related threats like damaging winds, storm surges, and inland flooding from heavy rainfall, and have an evacuation plan ready for themselves and their families.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-08 18:51:44+0000

Scientists have developed a new weapon against H.I.V.: a molecular mimic that invades a cell and steals essential proteins from the virus. A study published in Science reported that this viral thief prevented H.I.V. from multiplying inside monkeys. The new therapeutic approach will soon be tested in people, with four or five volunteers with H.I.V. receiving a single injection of the engineered virus. “This is imminent,” said Leor Weinberger, a virologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the study.

In a normal H.I.V. infection, the virus slips into an immune cell and hijacks its host’s DNA to make copies of itself, leading to the collapse of the immune system and causing AIDS. For decades, scientists have developed drugs that attack the virus itself, such as those that prevent a protein called protease from activating H.I.V. and lenacapavir, which blocks the proteins that form the virus’s shell. Twenty years ago, Dr. Weinberger set out to try an entirely different approach: creating an impostor virus that interfered with H.I.V.’s normal life cycle.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-08 18:00:07+0000
Veterans and Lawmakers Lobby for Approval of MDMA Therapy,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/health/fda-mdma-therapy.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The F.D.A. is considering an application for MDMA to help treat post-traumatic stress disorder. More than a half century after federal regulators banned most psychedelic compounds, this decision could mark a significant moment in the field of psychedelic medicine. The anticipated ruling has sparked a lobbying effort from veterans groups, researchers, and bipartisan lawmakers, with eighty lawmakers urging the Biden administration to approve the application from Lykos Therapeutics.

This campaign follows an expert panel's rejection of Lykos’s application due to perceived flaws in clinical trials and insufficient data. Representative Jack Bergman emphasized the urgency of the situation, highlighting the mental health crisis and suicide epidemic among military veterans. The lobbying effort reflects the high stakes surrounding psychedelic medicine, which has gained traction as universities establish research institutes focused on these substances.

Growing evidence suggests that compounds like MDMA, LSD, and psilocybin mushrooms may effectively treat challenging mental health conditions. Despite their potential, these substances remain classified as Schedule I drugs, indicating they have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-08 22:01:37+0000

Round and round a city-size iceberg goes, stuck in a vortex over an underwater mountain. The world’s largest iceberg, named A23a, near Antarctica, finally became loose in 2020 and began a slow drift toward the Southern Ocean. Now, A23a is spinning in place, having gotten stuck in a vortex over a seamount. Imagine a piece of ice about 1,500 square miles in area and as deep as the Empire State Building spinning slowly but steadily enough to fully rotate it on its head over the course of about 24 days.

The iceberg is spinning near the South Orkney Islands, about 375 miles northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula, maintaining a chill 15-degree rotation per day. “It’s basically just sitting there, spinning around and it will very slowly melt as long as it stays there,” said Alex Brearley, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey. A23a has been embroiled in drama since the start, a trait it picked up from its parent-berg, A23, which was one of three icebergs that broke off from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986. A23a broke off later that year and hit bottom in the Weddell Sea, where it would remain for 34 more years.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-09 22:18:28+0000
What Causes Dangerous Inflammation in Children With Covid?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/health/misc-autoimmune-children.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The sometimes fatal condition, MIS-C, may be driven in part by a misdirected immune system, a new study finds. When exposed to a virus, the human body marshals the immune system to fend off the intruder. Sometimes, the defense goes awry, and the body mistakenly turns against itself instead of the attacker. This sort of friendly fire drives multi-inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, a mysterious condition that in rare cases strikes children who have had a severe bout of Covid-19.

In a subset of children with the syndrome, immune cells become confused by the similarity between a protein carried by the coronavirus and one found throughout the human body, said Joseph DeRisi, an infectious disease expert and the president of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco, who led the study. This phenomenon is called molecular mimicry, Dr. DeRisi said. The study was published on Wednesday in the journal Nature. The results offer the first direct proof that Covid-19 sets off an autoimmune reaction that leads to MIS-C.

“This adds a very clear layer of evidence that there is an autoimmune component to MIS-C,” said Dusan Bogunovic, a pediatric immunologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the work. Scientists have long known that infections can befuddle the body into attacking itself, but the new study is among the first to identify the series of events and cast of immune characters involved in the process.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-07 16:31:28+0000
Heat Raises Fears of ‘Demise’ for Great Barrier Reef Within a Generation,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/climate/ocean-heat-great-barrier-reef.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A new study found that temperatures in the Coral Sea have reached their highest levels in at least four centuries. This generation will probably see the demise of the Great Barrier Reef unless humanity acts with far more urgency to rein in climate change, according to scientists in Australia. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world and is often called the largest living structure on Earth. The study, published in the journal Nature, found that recent extreme temperatures in the Coral Sea are at their highest in at least 400 years. It included modeling that showed what has been driving those extremes: greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans burning fossil fuels and destroying natural places that store carbon, like forests. 

“The heat extremes are occurring too often for those corals to effectively adapt and evolve,” said Ben Henley, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Melbourne. “If we don’t divert from our current course, our generation will likely witness the demise of one of Earth’s great natural wonders, the Great Barrier Reef.” The study’s scientific prose stated, “The existential threat to the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem from anthropogenic climate change is now realized.” Tanya Plibersek, Australia’s environment minister, emphasized the government's responsibility to act on climate change and safeguard the reef, referencing a recent law aimed at reducing emissions by 43 percent by 2030.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-07 15:41:38+0000
Roach sprays don’t work,https://www.popsci.com/environment/roach-sprays-dont-work/,"This is an article by Popular Science. In his line of research, Zachary DeVries has seen a lot of German cockroach infestations. New research from DeVries and a team of colleagues offers a clear answer to whether consumer bug sprays are effective against these pests: a resounding ‘no’. Common consumer insecticide sprays and aerosols are ineffective against German cockroach infestations, according to a study published in the Journal of Economic Entomology. The study tested four consumer products and found that while they killed susceptible lab strain cockroaches, they were inadequate for managing field-collected populations. All four products demonstrated weak residual effects, meaning roaches exposed to treated surfaces usually survived. The researchers found that the insects needed to be in continued contact with a treated surface for between eight and 24 hours to achieve complete mortality, a scenario unlikely to occur in real-world settings. Moreover, applying these sprays carries potential health risks, and the study highlights deficiencies in the testing requirements for these products. DeVries and Gordon hope their research can spur regulatory changes to improve product testing. Effective strategies for managing roach infestations include proper sanitation and using bait products rather than sprays.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-14 10:00:00-0400
Extremely rare tardigrade fossils seen in unprecedented detail,https://www.popsci.com/science/extinct-tardigrade-pictures/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Multiple ancient and extinct species of tardigrades, aka “water bears,” can now be seen in unprecedented, high-resolution detail thanks to high-powered microscopy tools. With these new observations, researchers believe they have helped resolve some of the many lingering mysteries within the history of these tiny invertebrates. Tardigrades are some of the most resilient and oldest creatures on Earth, with their earliest ancestors traced back as far as 500 million years ago to the Cambrian Period. Today’s tardigrade species likely first evolved between 155 and 66 million years ago during the Cretaceous Era. What sets today’s over 1,100 tardigrade species apart is their ability to undergo cryptobiosis, allowing them to survive extreme conditions. Researchers at Harvard University’s Museum of Comparative Zoology examined 72-83 million-year-old amber containing two tardigrade fossils, Beorn leggi and Aerobius dactylus. The fossils provided new insights into the evolutionary history of tardigrades, revealing that at least two separate groups evolved cryptobiosis at different times in the past. The study suggests that the shared development of cryptobiosis may have helped tardigrades evade extinction. However, with only four tardigrade fossils ever discovered, researchers still face challenges in piecing together their evolutionary journey. Advances in microscopy are paving the way for further discoveries as more fossils are found.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-14 09:35:25-0400

AI tongue scanner can diagnose illnesses with 96 percent accuracy,https://www.popsci.com/technology/ai-tongue-scanner/,"This is an article by Popular Science. A new artificial intelligence machine learning model is capable of accurately diagnosing certain illnesses nearly every time by simply looking at a patient’s tongue. This technology draws inspiration from medical approaches utilized by humans for over 2,000 years, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine, which often examines the tongue for clues about health issues. The color, shape, and thickness of the tongue can indicate various ailments, including cancer, diabetes, asthma, and gastrointestinal issues. Researchers from the University of South Australia and Iraq’s Middle Technical University have developed a system that analyzes tongue characteristics, with tongue color being particularly significant. For instance, a yellow tongue may indicate diabetes, while a purple tongue could suggest cancer. The team trained their machine learning model using over 5,000 images of tongues, both healthy and unhealthy, and tested it with real-time data from volunteers. The results showed remarkable precision, with an accuracy rate exceeding 98 percent in detecting ailments based on tongue color changes. This research suggests the potential for integrating AI systems into medical facilities for efficient disease screening.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-13 12:50:44-0400
Ultrasonic tools could one day track wind speeds on Mars,https://www.popsci.com/science/ultrasonic-wind-speeds-mars/,"This is an article by Popular Science. What’s the weather like on Mars? Beyond the obvious—it’s pretty cold, mostly—this has proven a difficult question to answer. Developing a detailed understanding of Mars’ atmospheric dynamics requires data on the turbulence that drives the planet’s weather—data that the various landers that have visited the Martian surface over the years have lacked the instruments to provide. However, a new paper published August 13 in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America describes designs for devices that might be able to change this: sophisticated wind speed sensors sturdy enough to operate on Mars. The new paper explains that these eddies “are the dominant mechanism by which heat, momentum, and molecules are transferred from the surface.” However, studying them requires “a wind sensor that can resolve not only the horizontal winds, but also the generally much more gentle vertical winds and horizontal wind perturbations associated with the turbulent eddies.” On Earth, such measurements are often made with ultrasonic anemometers, devices that work by sending pulses of very high frequency sound waves between a pair of transducers. To determine whether existing anemometers would be sufficiently robust for Mars, the researchers put four candidate models through their paces in settings designed to emulate the Martian environment. The devices were, as expected, affected by the environment. However, by allowing for these effects, researchers were able to make measurements with strikingly low error ranges: as little as 0.14% for wind speed and 0.07% for the speed of sound. According to co-author Robert White, this new method is, “10 times faster and 10 times more accurate than anything previously used on Mars.”",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-13 12:33:32-0400
"Rare, endangered ocelot caught on camera",https://www.popsci.com/science/ocelot-video-arizona/,"This is an article by Popular Science. For the first time in half a century, an ocelot has been spotted in the Atascosa Highlands region of southern Arizona. The endangered wild cat was caught on cameras installed by The Phoenix Zoo’s Atascosa Complex Wildlife Study in June. A multi-agency review confirmed that it was a new cat, not previously seen in the state. The cameras were first installed in April, and during a routine check in July, the team discovered the ocelot footage, which elicited excitement and disbelief from the researchers. Arizona Game and Fish Department confirmed the finding, stating that this is indeed a new ocelot based on pelage spot analysis. Since 1972, ocelots have been listed as endangered in the United States, with fewer than 100 remaining in the wild. These carnivores primarily eat birds, rabbits, rodents, and lizards, facing threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. The Atascosa Highlands is a well-known wildlife corridor but remains relatively understudied. The Phoenix Zoo plans to return to the field to gather more data and collect environmental DNA samples to better understand the mammal ecology in the area.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-13 11:02:35-0400

Earth is covered in ‘Gates of Hell’,https://www.popsci.com/environment/gates-of-hell-on-earth/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Our planet is full of beautiful and awe-inspiring geological features, but some evoke a sense of doom or foreboding. Throughout history, various natural sites have been referred to as entryways into the underworld, such as ‘hell’s gate’ or ‘mouth of hell.’ According to Francesco Perono Cacciafoco, a professor of linguistics, place names often reflect local culture, spirituality, and myth. Many civilizations have local stories about landscape features leading to the land of the dead, with the ‘gates of hell’ appearing universally across cultures. 

The Batagay Crater in Siberia, known as a “doorway” to the underworld, has gained a mythic reputation among the indigenous Yakut people. The Darvaza Gas Crater in Turkmenistan, commonly referred to as the “Door to Hell,” emits methane and has been burning since the mid-20th century. Namibia’s Skeleton Coast, called “The Gates of Hell” by Portuguese sailors, is notorious for its treacherous conditions. Hell’s Gate National Park in Kenya has various origins for its name, while Masaya caldera in Nicaragua was dubbed “Mouth of Hell” by Spanish colonizers. 

Mount Hekla in Iceland and Mt. Osore in Japan are also historically linked to the underworld, with the latter being a sacred Buddhist site.

New species of extinct walrus discovered,https://www.popsci.com/environment/walrus-discovered/,"This is an article by Popular Science. A team of paleontologists have uncovered a new species of extinct walrus that lived roughly 5.3 million years ago. Ontocetus posti bears some surprising similarities in feeding adaptations to the modern walrus Odobenus rosmarus. The fossilized remains were discovered in Norwich, England, and Antwerp, Belgium, with the Belgian specimens uncovered by study co-author Mathieu Boisville. The team conducted a detailed analysis of the mandible, initially thinking it was the species Ontocetus emmonsi, but found unique features indicating a different species. These anatomical characteristics suggest that Ontocetus posti was well adapted to suction-feeding similar to its living relatives. The findings emphasize how changes in the environment shaped the adaptations and survival of marine mammals. This convergence of feeding adaptations shows how constantly shifting evolutionary processes occur across different time periods. The team hopes to find more fossils to learn about past climate changes and adaptations. Walruses used to be more diverse and covered a wide geographical area, remaining key indicators of climate change. The discovery aims to reinforce the importance of conservation for these vulnerable animals.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-13 07:00:00-0400
SpaceX accused of dumping polluted Starship wastewater in Texas for years,https://www.popsci.com/science/spacex-mercury-water-pollution/,"This is an article by Popular Science. SpaceX’s Starship launches at the company’s Starbase facility near Boca Chica, Texas, have allegedly been polluting the local environment for years, possibly in violation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water Act. The issues stem from a complaint filed to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regarding 14 separate incidents of environmental impacts from the facility’s deluge system. Despite the installation of a water deluge system, the first launch resulted in damages to local endangered species’ nesting and migration sites, as well as a fire at Boca Chica State Park. Ahead of its second launch, SpaceX reportedly bypassed regulatory permit processes regarding pollutant discharge limits and failed to provide detailed explanations on wastewater treatment. The EPA issued SpaceX a formal notice of violation, yet the company proceeded with another launch using the unauthorized system. Concerns have also been raised about the mercury content in Starship’s wastewater, with lab reports indicating significant discrepancies in measurements. Local residents have voiced concerns about the dangerous conditions created by the rocket’s engines, describing the noise and physical effects as “truly frightening.” In April 2024, community and environmental organizations expressed anger over the tests, highlighting the proximity of Starbase to indigenous sacred lands. SpaceX has stated that it is committed to working with local and federal partners to be good stewards of the environment, while Elon Musk dismissed the allegations as “factually inaccurate.” The FAA has postponed public environmental impact assessment meetings related to Starship’s future test launches, seeking additional information from SpaceX.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-12 15:40:33-0400
NASA data suggests there’s liquid water deep beneath Mars’ surface,https://www.popsci.com/science/mars-liquid-water/,"This is an article by Popular Science. One of the prerequisites for life as we know it is liquid water—and there’s direct evidence of it having once existed on Mars. However, a new study published August 9 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that there may be liquid water on Mars today—or, more accurately, in Mars. The study suggests that there’s liquid water deep in the Martian crust—at least five miles down, and potentially as far as 15 miles. This means that we’re unlikely to ever be able to study this water directly, as drilling even a kilometer into the crust is extremely difficult. The important factors for the existence of liquid water at these depths are heat from the planet’s core and the ambient pressure. The study is based on data gathered by NASA’s InSight lander, which operated until late 2022 and provided extensive information about Martian geology. The team’s results suggest that the InSight data is best explained by “a water-saturated mid-crust.” The presence of water deep in the Martian crust raises questions about how that water got there and where it came from. This is exciting news, as scientists have hypothesized that if life did evolve on Mars billions of years ago, some vestiges might remain in the aquifers suggested to exist deep in the Martian crust.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-12 15:00:00-0400

This ancient crocodile looked kind of like a dolphin,https://www.popsci.com/science/ancient-crocodile-dolphin/,"This is an article by Popular Science. A set of 135 million-year-old fossils, once thought lost during World War II, are now accounted for and analyzed. According to a study published July 18 in the Journal of Systematic Paleontology, a team of international researchers from Germany and the UK has determined the “well preserved” skull and first neck vertebrae are from what they now call Enalioetes schroederi. These ancient marine crocodiles likely looked more like dolphins than reptiles. Between the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous period, oceans were populated by multiple crocodyliform Metriorhynchidae species, known for their distinct body shapes. Unlike today’s scaly crocodiles, metriorhynchids featured flippers, a tailfin, and smooth, scaleless skin, making them speedy swimmers that fed on fish and squid. Some species evolved large, serrated teeth, indicating a diet that included other marine reptiles. Most metriorhynchids lived during the Jurassic period, but E. schroederi continued to evolve into the Cretaceous. The fossils were first discovered around 1916 and were believed lost until they were found in the Minden Museum in Western Germany. A team from Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld and the University of Edinburgh studied the rediscovered fossils, revealing significant details about the internal anatomy of these marine crocodiles. The new information shows how metriorhynchids evolved a body plan radically different from other crocodiles during the Cretaceous Period.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-12 11:57:56-0400

The hunt for the first stars in the universe,https://www.popsci.com/science/oldest-stars-in-universe/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Telescopes are time machines, and astronomers are using them to find the first stars ever formed in the universe. These early generations of stars, known as Population III stars, were crucial to shaping the universe we know today. Back in the early days of the cosmos, there were no stars to light up the universe yet. At that time known as the “dark ages,” only the very lightest elements—mainly hydrogen and helium—had formed. At some point, the first stars coalesced from that hydrogen and helium haze, lighting up the universe and gathering into the first galaxies. Because Population III stars were the first, they created the conditions and elemental abundances that the stars in our galaxy formed from. Those early generations of Population III stars were more massive on average than today’s stars, lacking strong stellar winds and having short lifetimes. Once they died, they seeded the universe with metals for future generations. Although we haven’t seen any Population III stars yet, astronomers hope to find evidence of them using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). JWST can look back to just a billion years after the universe began, and astronomers are exploring various methods, including gravitational lensing, to detect these elusive stars.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-12 08:28:38-0400

There are few birds in the northern hemisphere quite as striking and easily identifiable as a puffin. With its red-orange, yellow, and black beak, bold black and white feathers, and perpetual puppy dog eyes, people travel from all over the world to catch a glimpse. But on the south coast of Iceland in August and September, you might see more than cameras snapping pictures of diving birds; you might also spot people casually tossing puffin chicks off cliffs in the dark. This is puffling season, the time of year when puffin chicks (called pufflings) are ready to leave the nest and spend the next few months out on the open ocean. But climate change and the conveniences of modern society like city lights are threatening the birds’ survival. When vulnerable birds are distracted and tempted inland by mistake, some humans give them a literal helping hand by rounding them up and casting the baby birds out to sea in the name of conservation.

Butterflies anchor cocoons with silk Velcro and seat-belts,https://www.popsci.com/science/how-butterflies-attach-cocoon/,"This is an article by Popular Science. A chrysalis needs to be perfect when a caterpillar or silkworm prepares to transform from pupae to winged adults. Since the insect can’t emerge until it has completely matured, any overlooked structural flaws or weaknesses may prove fatal for them. But just as important is a chrysalis’ ability to remain anchored in place—and according to a new study, when it comes to metamorphosis, a butterfly’s delicate silk threads are some of its strongest and most reliable tools. Researchers at China’s Southwestern University recently studied the life cycles of two butterfly species—Danaus chrysippus (plain tiger) and Papilio polytes (common Mormon)—and two silkworm species. When it came time for the butterfly and silkworm caterpillars to build their respective chrysalises and cocoons, the team watched as the insects each spun silk into net-like pads. Using an arm-like appendage called a cremaster, they then attached their chrysalis or cocoon to a branch. “The connection between the cremaster and silk pad was observed to be similar to that between the hook and loop of a Velcro fastener,” the authors explain. Once the insects began undergoing metamorphosis, the team then collected silk samples to measure their diameter and tensile strength. The new study highlights the intense complexity and planning that needed to successfully undergo metamorphosis. So the next time you see a cocoon or chrysalis outside, pause a moment to admire their incredible strength.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-09 15:06:07-0400
Researchers worry about AI turning humans into jerks,https://www.popsci.com/technology/openai-jerks/,"This is an article by Popular Science. It has never taken all that much for people to start treating computers like humans. Ever since text-based chatbots first gained mainstream attention in the early 2000s, some tech users have spent hours conversing with machines, forming what they believe are genuine friendships and even romantic relationships. OpenAI researchers are warning about the potential pitfalls of getting too close to these models, noting that the realistic conversational rhythm of their new GPT4o chatbot could lead users to anthropomorphize the AI and trust it as they would a human. This added comfort could make users more susceptible to believing fabricated AI “hallucinations” as true statements. The report suggests that extended conversations with convincingly human-sounding AI could impact human-to-human interactions, potentially leading to awkwardness or rudeness in real-life conversations. 

While more human-like chatbots could benefit lonely individuals and help anxious people build confidence, there are concerns that reliance on these models might reduce the perceived need for human interaction. The researchers emphasize the need for further testing to understand the long-term effects of these relationships. The report's caution contrasts with OpenAI's strategy of rapidly releasing new products, raising questions about the company's commitment to safety. Ultimately, it remains uncertain whether OpenAI will prioritize safety research or focus on expanding its user base with new features.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-09 14:28:19-0400
Milwaukee wants to build the world’s tallest timber skyscraper (again),https://www.popsci.com/technology/worlds-tallest-timber-skyscraper-milwaukee/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Milwaukee has been home to the world’s tallest timber skyscraper for barely two years, but the city is already aiming to more than double that height. Last month, Wisconsin’s largest metropolis announced plans for a new, unnamed project that will feature up to 55 floors built largely from engineered mass timber materials. If all goes according to plan, the skyscraper will be nearly 600-feet-tall when complete—far surpassing Milwaukee’s current record-holder, the 25-story Ascent tower completed in 2022. The 1.2 million square foot endeavor will be part of the ongoing Marcus Performing Arts Center renovations and overseen by Michael Green Architecture (MGA), a firm specializing in modern timber construction methods. Planned to unfold over multiple phases, the 55-story high-rise could include up to 750 residential units, 190,000 square feet of office space, 40,000 square feet of retail space, 300 hotel rooms, and 1,100 structured parking spaces. The idea of a timber skyscraper may conjure images of rickety towers, but mass timber materials are factory-made and designed to withstand stress and environmental pressures. Mass timber supplies are increasingly popular because they are often cheaper, lighter, and more eco-friendly than concrete and steel. However, there are still safety limits for how high architects can build structures solely from mass timber, with new International Building Code standards limiting mass timber-only projects to 18 floors. Despite these challenges, ambitious eco-friendly architecture alternatives are always a welcoming sight, and if all goes according to plan, Milwaukee will likely secure its record-holding status for a while.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-09 12:15:00-0400
You’ve never seen a prettier radiation-spewing supermassive black hole,https://www.popsci.com/science/sprial-galaxy-messier-106-jwst/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Messier 106, also known as NGC 4258, is the star of a new image taken with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This swirling galaxy, located about 23 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici, is one of the brightest and is relatively close to our own Milky Way galaxy. It has been the site of two supernova detections in 1981 and 2014. Like most spiral galaxies, Messier 106 has a supermassive black hole at its center, which is actively consuming material. As gas spirals toward the black hole, it heats up and emits powerful radiation. The JWST captured this image using its Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) as part of a program to study the galaxy's active galactic nucleus. The image reveals a bright central region dominated by light from dust and gas falling into the black hole. Notably, the galaxy features two 'anomalous' extra arms composed of hot gas, likely resulting from the black hole's activity. These arms are visible in radio and X-ray wavelengths, showcasing the dynamic processes occurring around the black hole. Messier 106 was discovered by Pierre Méchain, an assistant to Charles Messier, but was never cataloged during Messier's lifetime.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-09 11:35:36-0400

Why records are better than CDs in the streaming age,https://www.popsci.com/technology/why-vinyl-records-are-better-than-cds/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Vinyl sales are trending up, with the RIAA reporting that in 2023, 43 million records were sold in the US compared to 37 million CDs. Vinyl sales generated $1.4 billion, making up 71 percent of physical sales, while downloads accounted for $434 million. Despite the overwhelming preference for streaming, which earned $14.4 billion in 2023, the rise of vinyl is intriguing. Many consumers are willing to pay more for a less convenient format, as owning a physical record offers a sense of ownership that streaming does not. 

While some argue that vinyl has superior sound quality, the real appeal lies in the tangible support it provides to artists. Buying records allows fans to contribute more significantly to their favorite musicians compared to streaming, where artists earn very little per play. The larger format of records also enhances the visual experience, allowing album art to be appreciated in a way that streaming and CDs cannot. 

In a digital world, the physicality of records offers a charming contrast, creating a ritualistic experience when choosing an album to play. Although CDs have advantages like portability, they are less relevant in the streaming age, where convenience is already maximized. As a result, vinyl buyers are likely to continue purchasing records, even while maintaining streaming subscriptions.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-08 16:02:00-0400
"‘What goes up, must come down:’ Junk satellites are a looming hazard",https://www.popsci.com/science/space-junk-satellites/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Elon Musk’s SpaceX and its competitors are making reliable satellite internet services a reality with a growing number of satellites in orbit. SpaceX’s Starlink service reportedly provides broadband to around three million users, including those in remote areas.

Scientists think atmospheric ‘glitter’ can warm Mars over 50 degrees,https://www.popsci.com/science/mars-glitter-terraform/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Researchers believe that a key ally in thawing out the icy, barren wastelands of Mars is glitter—specifically, millions of tons of reflective metallic nanorod particles seeded throughout the planet's atmosphere. This proposal is estimated to be 5,000 times more efficient than previous ideas for terraforming Mars. The ultimate goal for some is to transform Mars into a livable second home for humanity. Various theories have been proposed over the years, including vaporizing polar ice caps and using silica aerogel to trap heat. The recent plan, published in Science Advances, suggests using nanorods made from Mars' iron- and aluminum-rich surface dust to trap heat and scatter sunlight, potentially raising temperatures by over 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Releasing these particles at a rate of 30 liters per second could begin warming Mars within months. While this approach is dramatic, it is only the first step toward making Mars habitable. There are uncertainties regarding how long the particles would remain in the atmosphere and the potential health hazards of metal-laden rain. However, achieving temperatures of -30 degrees Fahrenheit could support microbial life and certain crops, essential for future colonization.

While elephants have the reputation as animals who never forget, they may have some competition from some primates. Lemurs use their long-term memory in combination with smell and social cues to find hidden fruit. This technique may have deep evolutionary roots, according to a study published in the International Journal of Primatology. “Our study provides evidence that lemurs can integrate sensory information with ecological and social knowledge, which demonstrates their ability to consider multiple aspects of a problem,” said study co-author Elena Cunningham. Animals that forage typically rely on their senses, social knowledge, and environmental cues to locate food and water. In the new study, the team observed a group of lemurs at the Lemur Conservation Foundation in Florida. They hid pieces of cantaloupe in cardboard takeout containers and noted how the lemurs investigated and opened them. The lemurs quickly learned which containers had fruit and could remember their locations for days, weeks, and even months. The study showed that the lemurs' strategies for finding fruit were influenced by social factors, with some groups sharing information more willingly than others. “What our study shows is that these three factors are all operating at the same time,” Cunningham noted.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-08 09:43:42-0400

More than a billion birds could be dying from flying into buildings each year in US,https://www.popsci.com/environment/birds-die-buildings/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Glass windows are a marvel of human engineering, allowing natural light into buildings, but they pose a significant threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Birds often fail to recognize glass as a barrier, leading to fatal collisions. Recent research indicates that the mortality rate for birds that collide with windows is much higher than previously thought, with about 60 percent dying even after receiving care. Estimates suggest that well over 1 billion birds die each year in the U.S. from building collisions. The study highlights that many birds that appear to recover after a collision may still succumb to their injuries later. 

The researchers analyzed data from wildlife rehabbers in northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, finding that only 39.5 percent of birds brought in after window strikes were released back into the wild. The study emphasizes the importance of prevention, as windows are a significant cause of avian mortality, second only to feral cats. Strategies such as using bird-safe glass and implementing lights-out initiatives during migration can help reduce these collisions. The findings underscore the need for community action to create safer environments for birds, which play a crucial role in our ecosystem. If we want to protect bird populations, we must rethink how we design and interact with our built environments.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-07 14:02:28-0400

China’s super-secret space plane spotted above Europe,https://www.popsci.com/science/china-space-plane-image/,"This is an article by Popular Science. So little is known about Shenlong, China’s ultra-secret, reusable space plane that there aren’t even publicly verifiable photos of the experimental aircraft. But that doesn’t mean knowledgeable astronomy enthusiasts can’t catch glimpses of the vehicle as it orbits Earth, as was recently the case for Felix Schöfbänker in Upper Austria. Based on his July 30 images first highlighted by Space.com, Schöfbänker theorizes he possibly identified a pair of previously unknown features on Shenlong’s underside—potentially a pair of solar panels that help power the craft. Space planes like Shenlong are designed for multi-year, uncrewed orbital missions after hitching a ride aboard a rocket. China’s mysterious robotic vehicle has completed at least two confirmed missions since 2020, the second of which lasted 276 consecutive days in orbit above Earth. Its current mission began after launching from a Chinese space agency facility in the Gobi Desert on December 14, 2023. Since then it has released at least seven confirmed objects of unknown purpose into orbit. Speaking with Space.com on August 5, Schöfbänker explained that he used a telescope with a 14-inch mirror along with various other tools allowing him to follow satellites while automatically keeping them centered in view. Although its wings are not visible in the grainy imagery, it is still believed that Shenlong’s wingspan is at least wide enough to necessitate small cutouts in China’s Long March 2F rocket used to deliver it into orbit. Shenlong isn’t the only experimental space plane currently conducting secretive missions above Earth; the US Space Force’s X-37B has been working on its own endeavors since its latest launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on December 28, 2023.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-07 13:35:27-0400

Love corn? Thank interbreeding,https://www.popsci.com/environment/corn-evolution/,"This is an article by Popular Science. The story of corn is anything but corny. It’s a tale of resilience and survival–all because maize was selfish (genetically). Maize and its numerous varieties have quickly adapted to several types of climates over several millennia, while feeding countless generations in the Americas. Now, a team of scientists believe that a genetic process called selfish inheritance may be responsible for this rapid evolution. About 9,000 years ago, maize was first domesticated by Indigenous peoples in the Mexican lowlands. Roughly 5,000 years later, maize crossed with a different type from the Mexican highlands called teosinte mexicana, resulting in cold adaptability and rapid spread across the continent. Scientists are still not quite certain how it achieved all of this so quickly. In the new study, researchers sequenced the genomes of hundreds of pollen grains of the semi-sterile offspring and found that the same pieces from the teosinte genome were present in each. They identified a gene called Dicer-like 2, which is responsible for a “selfish” genetic system they call the Teosinte Pollen Drive. This suggests the selfish genetic system was active over a long period of time and could have wider implications on agriculture and the process of domestication in all living things.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-07 11:00:00-0400

Sea lion camera crews help scientists map unexplored seabeds,https://www.popsci.com/science/sea-lion-cameras/,"This is an article by Popular Science. Scientists have a new ally helping them explore the ocean’s seabeds–sea lions. A team in Australia recruited endangered Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) to carry video cameras down to this little explored region of the ocean. The videos helped the team identify some previously unmapped sea lion habitats in the benthic zone–or the lowest ecological zone in a body of water. The pinniped-assisted findings are described in a study published August 7 in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. Dives with remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) can be costly and logistically prohibitive. “Using animal-borne video and movement data from a benthic predator is a really effective way of mapping diverse benthic habitats across large areas of the seabed,” said Nathan Angelakis, a study co-author. In the study, eight adult female Australian sea lions were equipped with small and lightweight cameras. The team gathered 89 hours of animal-borne video and identified six benthic habitats. This method can also be used to survey and assess other marine species of interest that the sea lions caught on camera. Assessing a marine environment from a predator’s perspective can improve our understanding of the benthic environment and develop a more complete map of the seabed.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-07 00:00:00-0400

New ‘Hobbit’ fossils discovered on Indonesia’s Flores island,https://www.popsci.com/science/hobbit-fossils/,"This is an article by Popular Science. An international team of archeologists and researchers on the Indonesian island of Flores found new fossils belonging to the rare early human species Homo floresiensis, often referred to as the 'Hobbits' due to their small stature. The study, published in Nature Communications, details three roughly 700,000-year-old bones that provide insights into the evolution of this species. Evidence suggests that these early humans stood about 3.4 feet tall and lived as recently as 50,000 years ago, while Homo sapiens were already established in Australia. The new fossils were discovered in Mata Menge, about 46 miles from the Liang Bua cave, where previous evidence of Homo floresiensis was first uncovered in 2003. 

The newly found fossils pre-date the Liang Bua hominins by about 650,000 years and belong to at least three individuals, indicating they may have had even smaller jaws and teeth. The team discovered the first postcranial element of Homo floresiensis, a distal shaft of an adult humerus, which suggests a height of about 3.2 feet, making it the smallest upper arm bone known from the hominin fossil record. This discovery supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of Homo floresiensis were extremely small in body size. The two teeth found also show characteristics similar to early Homo erectus from Java, but do not confirm a direct evolutionary link. The evolutionary history of the Flores hominins remains largely unknown, but the new fossils suggest that they may have evolved from early Asian hominins that became isolated on the island.",Science & Technology,Popular Science,2024-08-06 11:00:00-0400

Egypt’s oldest pyramid may have been built using a hydraulic lift,https://www.popsci.com/science/pyramid-hydraulic-lift/,"This is an article by Popular Science. The honor of Egypt’s oldest necropolis belongs to Pharaoh Djoser, a ruler who ushered in the Old Kingdom’s Third Dynasty during the 27th century BCE. Constructed around 2,680 BCE in Saqqara, the six-tier, four-sided Step Pyramid of Djoser stood amid a large courtyard filled with decorative ceremonial structures. A new study indicates at least one previously unknown aid—a hydraulic lift system utilizing a nearby, long-gone lake. Researchers hypothesize a structure near the Step Pyramid likely functioned as a “check dam” for capturing water and sediment. This ancient engineering structure allowed the sediment to settle while water flowed through multiple compartments, eventually reaching pyramid shafts to help raise massive stones. The lift’s floating platform may have risen to around 55 feet, potentially using modifications to ascend higher. Researchers believe this hydraulic lift mechanism fundamentally alters what experts believe ancient Egyptians were capable of creating. The findings suggest that ancient Egyptians may have utilized similar systems in other Old Kingdom pyramids.

What science actually says about seed oils,https://www.popsci.com/health/are-seed-oils-bad-for-you/,"This is an article by Popular Science. If you consume social media, you may have heard: Seed oils are terrible for your health–even toxic! Cooking oils derived from seeds cause everything from heart disease to inflammation to fatigue to bad skin–according to a certain subset of Internet influencers. Yet contrary to the posts demonizing the common ingredients, a bevy of scientific research disagrees. There’re many different types of plant-based cooking oils, but when people talk about seed oils, they’re often referencing a list of eight: Canola, corn, cottonseed, soybean, sunflower, safflower, grapeseed, and rice bran oils. All of these eight oils contain fat and therefore fatty acids (an essential major nutrient group). A particular type of omega-6 compound, called linoleic acid, is at the center of most of the scorn against seed oils. Seed oil detractors argue that we are ingesting far too much linoleic acid, leading to the accumulation of byproducts like arachidonic acid, which they claim causes inflammation. However, scientific studies show that higher linoleic acid intake is associated with lower risk of death from all causes, including heart disease and cancer. The vast majority of scientific evidence indicates that cooking with omega-6 containing oils is harmless and probably good for you.

Study confirms that thinking hard is unpleasant,https://www.popsci.com/health/thinking-is-unpleasant-study/,"This is an article by Popular Science. According to new research from the American Psychological Association, mental exertion is linked to various unpleasant feelings and emotions in taxing situations. The findings, detailed in a study published in the journal Psychological Bulletin, suggest that while managers and teachers encourage mental effort, people generally dislike it. The study involved a meta-analysis of 170 studies with 4,670 participants from 29 countries, examining 358 different cognitive tasks. Across all populations, increased mental effort correlated with higher reports of irritation, frustration, annoyance, or stress. Notably, the association was less pronounced in studies from Asian countries, where individuals may have developed a higher tolerance for mental exertion due to their educational experiences. Despite the unpleasantness of mentally challenging tasks, people still engage in them voluntarily, often because they perceive potential rewards. This indicates that individuals may choose to pursue mentally effortful activities despite the discomfort, valuing the effort itself.

Common Artificial Sweetener Linked to Increased Heart Attack Risk in Small Study,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/common-artificial-sweetener-linked-to-increased-heart-attack-risk-in-small-study-180984868/,"This is an article by Smithsonian. The artificial sweetener erythritol may increase people’s risk of blood clots, a small study finds, potentially putting them at an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. Sugar was not observed to have the same effect. The findings, published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology, suggest that the health impacts of erythritol should be reevaluated. Researchers found that healthy individuals who consumed 30 grams of erythritol had significantly higher levels of the sweetener in their blood and were more likely to form blood clots compared to those who consumed glucose. Erythritol is commonly used as a sugar substitute in low-calorie and low-carbohydrate foods and drinks. The study raises concerns about the safety of erythritol, especially for individuals at high cardiovascular risk. Limitations of the study include its small sample size and the focus on a single instance of consumption. Future research should investigate the long-term effects of erythritol and other sugar substitutes on cardiovascular health. The evidence suggests that the FDA may need to reconsider erythritol’s safety designation.",Science & Technology,Smithsonian,2024-08-14 12:58:20+0000
How the Great Depression Fueled a Grassroots Movement to Create a New State Called Absaroka,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-great-depression-fueled-grassroots-movement-to-create-a-new-state-called-absaroka-180984873/,"This is an article by Smithsonian. In the 1930s, disillusioned farmers and ranchers sought to create a 49th state called Absaroka from parts of northern Wyoming, southeastern Montana, and western South Dakota. The movement gained traction in early 1935 amid widespread economic despair, with residents feeling neglected by their state governments. Sheridan, Wyoming, became the focal point for the secessionist sentiment, as locals rallied around the idea of forming a new state to address their grievances. Despite the grassroots support, the Absaroka proposal faced significant legal and political hurdles, as it required consent from multiple state legislatures and Congress. 

The movement garnered national media attention, prompting state governments to pay more attention to the needs of their rural populations. However, by 1936, interest in Absaroka waned, and the movement largely faded from public view. A revival attempt in 1939 led by A.R. Swickard, who declared himself governor of Absaroka, was met with skepticism and ultimately failed to gain traction. Despite the lack of official recognition, Swickard's antics brought temporary excitement to the region, but he eventually resigned amid scandals. 

The Absaroka dream never materialized, yet it remains a symbol of the frustrations felt by those in the region, echoing a desire for recognition and belonging that persists to this day.",Science & Technology,Smithsonian,2024-08-14 11:15:00+0000
Could These Carvings in Turkey Be the World's Oldest Lunisolar Calendar?,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-ancient-carvings-in-turkey-may-be-the-worlds-oldest-lunisolar-calendar-180984875/,"This is an article by Smithsonian. Thousands of years ago, the archaeological site known as Göbekli Tepe was home to a complex of temple-like structures. Located in what is now southern Turkey, the site is known for its pillars decorated with intricate carvings that still stand today. A researcher, Martin Sweatman from the University of Edinburgh, argues that one of these pillars could be an early calendar marking a comet that hit Earth roughly 13,000 years ago. The pillar features a series of rectangles and V-shaped symbols, which may represent the oldest known lunisolar calendar, tracking time using the movements of the sun and moon. Sweatman suggests that the 365 V-shaped symbols could represent days, indicating a calendar with 12 lunar months plus 11 extra days. He believes these carvings reflect ancient people's ability to record their observations of celestial events. Additionally, Sweatman posits that a comet strike around 10,850 B.C.E. may have triggered significant climate changes, leading to the extinction of large animals and the development of early civilization. This event could have initiated new religious practices and agricultural developments to adapt to the colder climate.",Science & Technology,Smithsonian,2024-08-13 20:57:21+0000
MDMA Treatment for PTSD Fails to Secure Federal Approval,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mdma-treatment-for-ptsd-fails-to-secure-federal-approval-180984887/,"This is an article by Smithsonian. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week declined to approve the psychedelic MDMA, also known as ecstasy, to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The agency has asked for an additional Phase 3 clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of the drug, according to a statement from Lykos Therapeutics, the company that had requested the approval. The decision is “a huge blow” to efforts to get psychedelics approved for treating mental health conditions, but some experts believe it will be a temporary setback. One day after the FDA’s decision, the journal Psychopharmacology retracted three papers on MDMA-assisted therapy due to unethical conduct by researchers associated with Lykos. The retractions came after the journal learned of unethical conduct by researchers at one of the study sites, including a case where a study participant was sexually abused by her therapists. Lykos has acknowledged that ethical violations were reported to the FDA and other bodies, but they regret not disclosing these to the journal. MDMA is considered a Schedule 1 drug, which means it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. The FDA’s decision marked the first time the agency had considered any Schedule 1 psychedelic for medical treatment. PTSD affects around 6 percent of the U.S. population at some point in their lives, and treatments are currently limited to talk therapy and two antidepressant medications. Had MDMA been approved, it would have become the first new treatment for PTSD in more than two decades.",Science & Technology,Smithsonian,2024-08-13 20:25:24+0000

Considering how long humans have been on Earth, it’s remarkable how much we’re still learning about how it works. A new study suggests that the break-up of an ancient continent sent ripples through Earth’s interior that reverberated for millions of years, creating dramatic plateau landscapes in places like South Africa, Brazil, and India. The edges of tectonic plates are known for spectacular geologic events, while interior regions are thought to be more stable. However, researchers have found that steep topographic features called Great Escarpments form when continents rift and split apart. This rifting warps the continental crust, initiating motion in the Earth’s mantle beneath it. The deformation causes an upwelling of hot material, which then cools and sinks, sending waves through the mantle. These waves strip off dense bottom layers of the continents, allowing the lighter material to rise. Researchers used a computer model to simulate the mantle waves generated by the break-up of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana and confirmed their findings with topographic maps and geologic data. The study suggests that these mantle waves could significantly impact Earth’s surface topography and ancient climates. Other geologists are excited by the findings, noting their potential implications for understanding Earth’s history.",Science & Technology,Smithsonian,2024-08-13 18:10:03+0000

A memorial honoring the millions of Americans who served in World War I is taking shape in Washington, D.C. Last month, crews began assembling the 58-foot-long bronze sculpture that will serve as the centerpiece of the new National World War I Memorial on the National Mall. The sculpture, titled A Soldier’s Journey, created by sculptor Sabin Howard, is currently shrouded in black plastic and protected by fences, but will be unveiled on September 13. The new $44 million memorial is located in Pershing Park across from the White House Visitor Center and was designed by architect Joe Weishaar. The sculpture depicts 38 figures in vivid scenes that tell the story of America’s involvement in the war, such as a daughter handing her father a helmet and nurses helping wounded soldiers. Howard aimed to create an experience that allows viewers, especially children, to engage with the history of World War I. Initial plans for the sculpture were much larger, but it is still expected to be the largest free-standing bronze relief in the Western Hemisphere. The piece was crafted using a combination of historical research, modeling, and advanced technology, culminating in a monumental effort to cast it in bronze.

A name meaning “anxiety” in Spanish, Zozobra is staged annually by the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe to mark the end of summer and kick off Fiesta de Santa Fe. This year’s event on Friday, August 30, marks the 100th burning. The spark for Zozobra came on Christmas Eve 1923, when local artist William Howard “Will” Shuster Jr. gathered Santa Fe’s first artist collective for dinner and inspired them to burn their troubles. The first public burning took place behind Santa Fe City Hall on September 3, 1926, with a six-foot figure. Over the decades, Zozobra has evolved in style and size, now standing at 50 feet, and the festival draws an average of 60,000 attendees.

The sun had just started to set when the lights on the streets of Athens turned on one by one, illuminating the Greek capital. On a cold winter night in early 2024, I followed Lydia Carras to her home, a beautiful neoclassical building in Plaka, one of the oldest neighborhoods in the world. Carras guided me around the front yard, which dates to the Middle Ages, and took me to a small Byzantine-era church. The most interesting part of her house was in the basement, where workers uncovered a previously unknown room behind a wall built in the sixth century B.C.E. This room contained a marble base that once held a statue of Hestia and a small well, speculated to date back to the Persian occupation of Athens. Athens has been shaped by the sufferings and triumphs of its past, with its Golden Age occurring between 480 and 404 B.C.E. The city later fell under various rules, including the Romans and Ottomans, before becoming the capital of Greece in 1834. Many houses in Plaka preserve remnants of ancient, Byzantine, and medieval eras, showcasing a multilayered testament to the city’s rich history. Today, the basement of the Brettos bar in Plaka houses a delicatessen, with a weathered column of unknown age supporting the ceiling.

Horses, bulls, and birds of all types live among the pink marshes of the Camargue, a rugged landscape shaped by the relentless push and pull of sea and river. A flamboyance of flamingos was feeding on plankton in a reed-lined marsh, their bodies reflected in the water beneath clouds blushed by the setting sun. The Camargue, set in the largest delta in Western Europe, has more water than land and more bulls than people, with thousands of birds migrating to its nutrient-dense terrain. It’s a colorful mosaic of verdant farmland, blue lagoons, sandy beaches, and white salt mounds sprouting from marshes tinged pink by microscopic shrimp. 

The region is best experienced in the slow lane, which I kept in mind as I rented a car in Marseille for a grand tour. Near Arles, the Rhone splits into two branches, and in this wishbone sits the roughly 300-square-mile Île de Camargue. The Rhone’s yearly floods have menaced the island since ancient times, and in 1869, Napoleon III completed a system of sea dikes and river canals that controlled the floods but transformed the landscape.

Is a Disney Theme Park Vacation Still Worth the Price?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/travel/disney-vacation-cost.html,"This is an article by New York Times. As Disney has raised the cost of tickets and hotel rooms at its theme parks, and added pricey, difficult-to-navigate tools, even its most loyal fans are asking themselves if they should rethink their vacations. Earlier this year, Jake Williams, a filmmaker and content creator in Toronto, made his long-awaited return to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. After not visiting since 2019, he was shocked by the changes, particularly the elimination of the Magical Express, a free bus service that transported guests from the airport to Disney resorts.

Now, guests must pay for shuttle services or use ride shares, adding to the overall cost of the trip. The end of the Magical Express highlights a larger issue: the cost of visiting Disney is increasing while perks are diminishing. Mr. Williams noted that a day in the parks and a one-night stay at Disney’s Port Orleans Riverside Resort cost him $886.34 for two adults, compared to $567.90 in 2017.

Avoiding Rental Car Toll Fees,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/travel/avoid-rental-car-toll-fees.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Paying tolls when you’re driving a rental car is largely unavoidable, but you can avoid paying hefty fees just to activate the device that allows you to pay tolls. In July, the Central Florida Expressway Authority began issuing free temporary toll passes to travelers who rent cars at Orlando International Airport. Travelers can download an app, register using a credit card, and get a toll pass in the form of a QR code that can be hung from a rearview mirror. These temporary toll passes allow travelers to avoid being charged extra fees to use a rental car company’s toll transponder.

This program is the first of its kind in the U.S. and could serve as a model for other destinations. Until then, there are other tips and tricks to avoid inflated car rental bills from toll-related surcharges. No single toll-pay app covers roads across the country, but several apps let you pay tolls from your phone. For example, GoToll covers roads in several states, while Ecotoll covers much of California, Texas, and the Northeast.

If you have your own toll pass, check which brand provides service where you are traveling.

The tonka bean, a wizened-looking South American seed, is beloved for its complex almond-vanilla scent, often appearing as an ingredient in perfumes. Outside the United States, it has long been utilized by chefs, but studies have indicated that coumarin, a chemical compound in the plant, can cause liver damage in animals, leading to the Food and Drug Administration banning the bean in commercial foods in 1954. However, with reports suggesting that the minuscule amounts used are harmless and the F.D.A. not actively enforcing the ban, tonka is making a comeback on dessert menus in the U.S. 

Pastry chef Thea Gould from La Cantine in Brooklyn uses tonka as a nut substitute, infusing it into panna cotta and whipped cream. Ana Castro, chef and owner of Acamaya in New Orleans, discovered tonka while working at Betony and has since used it in various dishes, including a custardy corn nicuatole.

Officials are investigating potential causes of a plane crash that killed 62 people near São Paulo. Brazilian forensic workers examined the wreckage of VoePass Flight 2283 in a residential area of Vinhedo, Brazil, on Saturday. The plane crashed on Friday, and investigators began analyzing the black boxes to understand why the passenger plane fell from 17,000 feet.

Aviation experts believe the plane had stalled, meaning its wings lost the lift needed to keep it aloft. John Cox, an airline pilot, stated, “You can’t get into a spin without stalling.” However, the reasons behind the stall remain unclear. Questions arise about whether the plane lost significant speed, if its nose pitched up too high, if ice built up on its wings, or if an engine failed. The effectiveness of the stall-warning system and the pilots' state of mind are also under scrutiny.

"How to Prevent Jet Lag, According to Very Frequent Travelers",https://www.nytimes.com/article/jet-lag-prevention.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A long flight can be exhausting, but recovering from it needn’t take up half your trip. Fatigue, irritability, dehydration, and brain fog are just a few of the unpleasant side effects of taking a far-flung trip, though even jumping a couple of time zones within the United States can wreak havoc on energy levels. Purported remedies for jet lag abound, but here are a few tried-and-true methods that can help you feel better faster.

“Jet lag is primarily caused by circadian desynchrony — a misalignment of the biological clock with sun time,” says Dr. Vishesh Kapur, founder of the Sleep Medicine Center at the University of Washington. Managing jet lag often comes down to manipulating your body’s exposure to light. He suggests using online tools like Jet Lag Rooster to get personalized instructions for adjusting your biological clock to match your destination’s daytime. It takes about a day per hour to adjust to a new time zone, so ideally, you should wake up earlier for a few days before your flight and expose yourself to natural sunlight.

Kapur emphasizes the importance of not starting out sleep deprived, as this can increase fatigue and sleepiness associated with jet lag. Architect Mariam Issoufou, who travels frequently, finds that exhausting herself the day before a flight helps her sleep better on the plane.",Travel,New York Times,2024-08-09 20:04:26+0000

It’s for a ship bigger than the Titanic, one that is nearly as long as the Chrysler Building is tall. A ship so luxurious that it was the first choice of presidents and royalty. A ship so trusted that it once carried the Mona Lisa. A vessel so fast that its mammoth propellers, churning the sea beneath its grand promenades and shipboard orchestras, were a Cold War state secret. A ship named the United States that Ms. Gibbs has come to adore. In fact, she has dedicated her life to saving it. Ms. Gibbs’s grandfather William Francis Gibbs was a famous ship designer, and the United States was his masterwork.",Travel,New York Times,2024-08-10 19:46:33+0000

New Hotels in New York That Revive the Romance of the Gilded Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/t-magazine/new-york-hotels-gilded-age.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Hotels are often agents of change in a neighborhood, and this is certainly true in New York, where a hotel boom has revitalized areas like Wall Street and NoMad. Since 2022, over 40 new properties have opened across the city, bringing fresh energy to both overlooked and popular areas. Notable newcomers include the Hotel Chelsea, a revival of a historic art-crowd hangout, and Nine Orchard, an elegant transformation of a 1912 bank building. The Fifth Avenue Hotel, located in NoMad, combines a 19th-century mansion with a modern glass tower, featuring interiors designed by Martin Brudnizki that evoke a romantic, bohemian atmosphere. Similarly, Fouquet’s New York offers a Parisian-inspired experience with luxurious decor and a subterranean spa. The Ned NoMad, another recent addition, continues this trend of opulent hospitality.

"Disney Parks Struggle, Exposing New Trouble Spot",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/media/disney-earnings-parks.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Companywide profit increased, the result of hit movies and streaming growth. But Disney said softening theme park demand “could impact the next few quarters.” Last year, Disney Experiences, a division that includes theme parks and cruise ships, contributed 70 percent of the company’s operating profit. In Disney’s seemingly never-ending game of corporate Whac-a-Mole, a new trouble spot has arisen: Americans — battered by years of high inflation — have less money to spend on amusement, imperiling growth at Disney theme parks.

On Wednesday, Disney reported weaker-than-expected theme park results for the three months that ended on June 29. Revenue increased 2 percent from a year earlier, to $8.4 billion, while operating profit declined 3 percent, to $2.2 billion. Disney blamed a “moderation of consumer demand” that “exceeded our previous expectations,” along with higher costs. Hugh F. Johnston, Disney’s chief financial officer, noted that the lower-income consumer is feeling stress, while the higher-income consumer is traveling internationally more.

Theme parks have taken on much greater financial importance at Disney over the past decade. Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has called theme parks and cruise ships “a key growth engine.”",Travel,New York Times,2024-08-07 13:53:38+0000
Microsoft Says Delta Was Largely Responsible for Flight Cancellations Amid Tech Outage,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/business/microsoft-delta-flight-cancellations-outage.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Microsoft criticized Delta Air Lines for falsely blaming the technology company for its decision to cancel thousands of flights following a tech outage. In a letter reviewed by The New York Times, Microsoft stated that Delta was attempting to deflect attention from its own issues by overstating Microsoft's role in the disruption. Delta canceled about 5,000 flights over four days after a global tech outage in mid-July, which was triggered by a flawed software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affecting various businesses, including airlines.

Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian, claimed the incident cost the airline approximately $500 million and has since pursued legal claims against Microsoft and CrowdStrike. Microsoft expressed empathy for Delta and its customers, stating it offered assistance after the outage, which was declined multiple times. The company suggested that Delta's struggles were due to outdated IT infrastructure and a lack of modernization compared to its competitors.

In response, Delta defended its investment in IT, asserting a long history of commitment to safe and reliable service. Microsoft has requested that Delta preserve documents related to the incident, indicating it would vigorously defend itself if legal action were taken.",Travel,New York Times,2024-08-06 17:56:38+0000
"Wild, Beautiful and Overlooked: Southern Sardinia Is Ready to Share Its Essence",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/travel/southern-sardinia-tourism-cagliari-tourism.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Buzz has been in short supply in southern Sardinia for some time now — some would say ever since the decline of the region’s Bronze Age Nuragic civilization. Yet on Italy’s second largest island, where sheep vastly outnumber people, there’s unmistakable new energy in Cagliari, its small Mediterranean capital, and the surrounding countryside. “We used to think of ourselves as rustic, as isolated in this island backwater,” a local lay historian, Venturino Vargiu, told me, as we watched the city’s annual folk costume extravaganza of Sant’Efisio. “But Sardinians are starting to understand that our culture has real value for us and for outsiders.”

In Cagliari, there’s a surge in pride, along with a wave of new development, mostly aimed at increasing the already growing numbers of tourists. In the rapidly transforming Marina neighborhood, a onetime fishermen’s enclave that is today a lively mix of immigrants and longtime residents, a promenade designed by architect Stefano Boeri will create a lush parkland along the waterfront. A light-rail line will connect the Marina with Cagliari’s hinterlands, and a new port, projected for 2026, is being constructed to move cruise ships farther away, allowing the yacht set to dock (and spend money) in Cagliari’s center.

For Cagliari and the south — which stretches out along a white-sand and cyan-sea coastline of stunning beaches — a tide of tourism could either prove destructive or be a boon to a region short on opportunity. But can a more harmonious form of travel be created in the south? With overtourism now the curse of many an Italian outpost, I visited the area and asked locals what might shape a better future.",Travel,New York Times,2024-08-08 11:52:34+0000
Five Adventures Beneath the Stars,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/travel/astrotourism-snorkeling-hiking-photography.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Travel adventures, from goat hikes to snorkeling, get even better when they’re done under the stars. Hiking and kayaking in the daytime? Fun and invigorating. But under a full moon, those activities can be transcendent. Gazing at blue skies is pleasant — but rather ordinary. Looking up at the night sky, on the other hand, feels as though deep mysteries may be revealed.

Astrotourism, travel devoted to stargazing and other celestial activities, is booming, spurred on, in part, by DarkSky International, which aims to protect the night skies from light pollution. The nonprofit organization has designated 220 dark sky areas around the world since its founding in 1988. “Viewing our starry night sky has connected humanity throughout the ages and allowed us to form a deep connection with the cosmos,” said Susan Serven, DarkSky’s communications director. 

It could be the breathtaking photos captured by the Hubble telescope or our growing awareness of light pollution that has helped catalyze interest, but the night skies are sparking invitations to explore in new ways.

Passenger Who Tried to Open Cockpit Gets 19 Months in Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/american-airlines-nj-passenger-sentenced.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Juan Rivas, a California man, was sentenced to 19 months in prison for attempting to open an exit and cockpit door on an American Airlines flight in 2022. Rivas, 52, threatened flight attendants with a champagne bottle and a plastic knife during the incident. He was arrested after the flight from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., was forced to make an emergency landing in Kansas City, Missouri, due to his behavior. Court records indicated that Rivas had used methamphetamines before the flight and panicked, claiming his family was in danger. 

He pleaded guilty in January and faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but prosecutors recommended a sentence of 41 to 51 months, citing his reckless actions. The prosecution argued that his drug use contributed to his behavior rather than an intentional effort to harm the aircraft.

Why Are Baseball Caps So Popular?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/style/baseball-caps-men-hats.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A reader reflects on the proliferation of baseball caps in men’s fashion, questioning their ubiquitous presence even in formal settings. The baseball cap, once a practical item for players, has evolved into a significant fashion statement. The concept of a hat for baseball games originated in 1849, but the modern baseball cap with its distinct shape and logo emerged in the late 19th century. It wasn't until the 1980s that the cap transitioned from sports to pop culture, becoming associated with iconic figures like Tom Selleck and various hip-hop artists.

This shift allowed the baseball cap to serve as a means of self-expression, enabling wearers to showcase individuality while adhering to professional attire. The trend has even reached high-fashion events, with celebrities like Chance the Rapper and Kylie Jenner incorporating caps into their looks at the Met Gala. The baseball cap has thus become a versatile accessory, blurring the lines between casual and formal wear.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-05 16:26:09+0000
Why Are So Many Men Wearing Sandals in NYC?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/style/sandals-mens-wear-city-streets.html,"This is an article by New York Times. If for most of recent urban history the preferred form of footwear for men in a city was the shoe, we have definitively entered a new era — the Age of the Sandal. This observation is based on a recent walking tour of Manhattan, where male-identified people were flaunting their toes in sandals. Whether this trend is due to a booming sandals market or simply the heat is uncertain.

Luxury labels have embraced this trend, showcasing sandals during spring runway shows in Europe. Designers have paired various styles with outfits that allow for full ventilation of the feet. Sandals are now produced by both renowned and obscure labels, available at every price point, from Greek fishermen sandals to high-end designer options.

The transformation of sandals from a niche hippie staple to a fashion universal is remarkable. The Birkenstock Arizona has become particularly popular, with the company reporting nearly $1.6 billion in revenues last year. Despite providing more coverage than flip-flops, sandals still display toes in a way that was once considered unsuitable for city streets.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-02 20:37:24+0000

Curator Kate Bailey noted the connection between Swift and the artwork, highlighting the emotional resonance of the painting with the themes present in Swift's music. The exhibition spans multiple floors of the museum, with Bailey already having walked over 8,000 steps on the day of the installation.

Kamala Harris Is Dressing to Be President,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/style/kamala-harris-presidential-style.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Over the last week, as Kamala Harris has stepped into the spotlight as the likely Democratic nominee for president, she has done so with a high-wattage smile, a pop culture boost, and a cascade of endorsements. In her campaign stops in various cities, Ms. Harris has appeared in the neutral pantsuits she adopted as her vice-presidential uniform, in shades of black, dark blue, burgundy, and beige, with occasional pops of salmon pink or baby blue. While the world may be embracing the “Kamala is brat” meme, the candidate herself is not.

Instead, she is wearing her usual tone-on-tone silk shells and pussy-bow blouses, along with her signature pearls and 70-millimeter Manolo Blahnik heels. For the last four years, this attire served as a perfect camouflage for the country’s No. 2 executive: somber, deferential, and somewhat dull. However, as she aims for the presidency, the question arises: does it look presidential?

In an election where she could be the first female president, the first female president of color, and the first president of South Asian descent, how she presents herself is crucial. Ashley Allison, a former Biden-Harris campaign adviser, noted that how a woman in leadership presents herself is a significant consideration.

Why Does My Teenager Insist on Wearing Used Clothes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/style/thrift-store-clothing-secondhand.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The first thing you have to ask yourself when it comes to what could be called the “fashion gap” is whether your discomfort is really about your child making inappropriate clothing choices, or about your own prejudices and preconceptions. We all bring our own sense of “appropriate” to our judgments about dress, and those senses are formed by the social and cultural stereotypes in which we came of age. Your reality is not necessarily your child’s reality, and understanding that is crucial to understanding how she is dressing. 

In a post-pandemic world where working from home and casual everyday clothing are the norm, a more relaxed kind of dressing has become the default. This means that before you even get into what your daughter is wearing, you have to understand why she’s wearing it — which means engaging with the question with empathy and curiosity, not judgment and disapproval. 

For instance, is your daughter thrifting because she feels passionately about sustainability? Is her choice a financial decision, or is it political, because she hates the elitism that fashion brands represent? Understanding her motivations can help bridge the gap between your perspectives on fashion.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-07-29 16:11:12+0000

In a small workroom on Pell Street in Chinatown, Evan O’Hara bent over a scrap of skin from an alligator’s leg and used a large cotton swab to dab it with electric orange dye.

Mr. O’Hara began hanging around Mr. Papai’s factory, asking the veteran craftsman questions and watching him work. Soon, an informal apprenticeship began. “He was a young kid, curious and polite, and I wanted to help the younger generation,” said Mr. Papai, who immigrated from Romania in 1984 and started out sweeping floors before eventually buying the factory where he once worked.

Between designer-less brands and rampant gossip, fashion is having a meltdown. On Monday, Tom Ford announced the departure of Peter Hawkings as creative director after just over a year, joining the ranks of Chanel, Givenchy, and Dries Van Noten, all operating without a designer or clear design direction. This unprecedented uncertainty is compounded by swirling speculation about other brands that still have artistic directors, often fueled by gossip.

Theories abound regarding potential designer moves, including Sarah Burton to Givenchy, Hedi Slimane leaving Celine for Chanel, and John Galliano's rumored exit from Margiela. Such rampant speculation, while occasionally entertaining, is often based on whispers and wishful thinking, and can be detrimental to designers, their teams, and consumers alike. Insecurity in the industry leads to safe, uninspired fashion choices, stifling creativity and innovation.

At Copenhagen Fashion Week, outfits on and off the runway had a lively spirit that reflected the event’s location in a country known for its quality of life. Not every fashion week can be characterized as friendly, approachable, and relaxed, but those are three ways to describe this event in Denmark. Although it has grown since its inception almost 20 years ago, it doesn’t attract the same crowds as fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan, and Paris. This has allowed Copenhagen Fashion Week to avoid some of the egos and excess associated with its more established counterparts, aided by sustainability requirements for participating brands.

The latest installment showcased a diverse array of attendees and collections. Brands like Remain experimented with mesh fabrics and sleek silhouettes, while Henrik Vibskov embraced frenetic patterns in vivid prints.

Allen’s first collection debuted during New York Fashion Week and features a cotton velvet cloak with oversize Victorian proportions, designed for both ritual ceremonies and everyday errands. The color palette of tangerine orange, snow white, and blood red is meant to be energizing and transformational.

She was 86. Her son, Christopher Claxton, said the cause was complications of dementia.

Ms. Moffitt started working with Mr. Gernreich as a fitting and show model in 1962. She viewed her role as more of a performer than a traditional model, stating, “I entertained myself and the audience by regarding the collection as a play, with each outfit a new act or a new character.” Initially hesitant about posing for the topless suit, she agreed under the condition that she would never wear it in public and that her husband, photographer William Claxton, would take the photo.

The suit gained international notoriety when it was banned in some countries and criticized by the Soviet newspaper Izvestia.

The tonka bean, a wizened-looking South American seed, is beloved for its complex almond-vanilla scent, often appearing as an ingredient in perfumes. Outside the United States, it has long been utilized by chefs, but studies have indicated that coumarin, a chemical compound in the plant, can cause liver damage in animals, leading the Food and Drug Administration to ban the bean in commercial foods in 1954. Recently, however, reports suggest that the minuscule amounts used to impart flavor are harmless, and the F.D.A. has shown little interest in enforcing the ban. As a result, tonka is making a comeback on dessert menus in the U.S. 

Pastry chefs like Thea Gould from La Cantine in Brooklyn have embraced tonka as a nut substitute, infusing it into panna cotta and whipped cream. Ana Castro, chef and owner of Acamaya in New Orleans, uses tonka to flavor dishes like custardy corn nicuatole and tres leches cake.

Five Generations Have Sold Clocks on This Island in Japan,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/fashion/watches-shinko-clock-shop-japan.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Time flows slowly on the island of Osaki-Shimojima, part of an archipelago off the southern coast of Japan’s main island, Honshu. Elderly fishermen pass the days on its stone embankments, trying to catch fish in the Seto Inland Sea. Some of the wooden buildings have stood along the narrow alleys of the island’s historical district of Mitarai for 250 years; most have roofs of the same traditional clay tiles, called kawara.

One of those buildings houses the Shinko Clock Shop, widely believed to be among the oldest clock and watch shops in Japan — although no one, not even the owners, knows precisely when it began to sell timepieces. Based on the dates on a local grave marker and some family documents, the Matsuuras say they believe the shop was established in the late 1700s to sell rice and other foodstuffs, then started to sell clocks sometime during the Meiji era (1868-1912). 

Now, Mr. Matsuura and his father, Keiichi, 79, handle sales and repairs, with family members taking on the accounting and other tasks.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-09 14:48:27+0000
"This Season, Tailoring Comes With Fringe Benefits",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/t-magazine/womens-suits-fall-fashion-tailor.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Feathers, fuzz, and other over-the-top textures add drama to serious suiting this season. Designers are embracing bold embellishments that transform traditional tailoring into something more expressive and playful. The use of fringe, feathers, and intricate textures not only enhances the visual appeal but also invites a sense of fun into the often-staid world of women's suiting. 

This trend reflects a broader shift in fashion, where comfort and individuality are prioritized alongside elegance. As women seek to express their personalities through their clothing, these textured pieces offer a fresh take on professional attire. The juxtaposition of classic silhouettes with extravagant details creates a striking balance that appeals to modern sensibilities. 

Fashion houses are responding with collections that feature vibrant colors and innovative materials, making tailored pieces more accessible and exciting. This season, the traditional suit is reimagined, allowing for personal expression while maintaining a polished look. The result is a celebration of femininity and strength, embodied in garments that are as versatile as they are stylish.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-08 09:03:49+0000
Three Watch Specialists Create the Quiet Club,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/fashion/watches-quiet-club-tokyo.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Three team members, two continents and one passion: watches. This is Quiet Club, the new house on the watchmaking block, which recently released its first timepiece, called Fading Hours. “The movement has been fully designed and made from scratch by our head watchmaker, Norifumi Seki,” said Hokuto Ueda, the brand’s chief executive. Mr. Seki, 26, is something of a boldface name in Asian watchmaking since his pocket watch, with a spherical moon phase plated in yellow gold and blued titanium, won the 2020 edition of the F.P. Journe Young Talent Competition. Mr. Seki’s partners in the business are Mr. Ueda, 40, who lives in Seattle and previously worked in automotive engineering, and Johnny Ting, 41, of San Francisco, whose background is in product and user experience design. Mr. Ueda and Mr. Ting initially met in the San Francisco Bay Area, where they worked for five years at Drivemode, an auto technology startup acquired by Honda in 2019. Mr. Ueda had challenged Mr. Ting, a longtime watch enthusiast, to use his background in user experience to design a timepiece. The watch’s name was inspired by the fader control on Mr. Ueda’s audio mixer, as the watch was designed to fade from notice when the wearer was concentrating on something else, and then fade back in when needed. After reading about Mr. Seki’s prize, they thought “it would be great if someone like this could be part of our project,” Mr. Ueda said, “so we could do something from the ground up.”",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-08 09:02:16+0000
"The Exaequo Melting Watch Looks, Well, Just Like That",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/fashion/melting-watch-exaequo-salvador-dali.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Exaequo’s new timepiece is a revival of a 1990s model inspired by a Dalí painting of misshapen clocks. The Swiss watch brand Exaequo Genève went out of business in 1998, ending production of its Softwatch, a cult favorite inspired by the misshapen clocks in a Salvador Dalí painting. Now Exaequo is back, with new ownership, and offering a new version of the watch that looks as if it is melting on your wrist — a design its website said reflected “the aesthetics of the Surrealist movement and the concept of fluid and unconventional time.” 

The brand initially closed after Dalí’s representatives sued it for using the artist’s signature on the watch dial without permission. However, the Softwatch has since become a collector’s item, with an engraved model sold for $4,480 in 2019. Andrea Casalegno, a watch brand consultant and horology influencer, praised the watch for its historical significance and great design. Chris Zocchi, working with investors including the Italian watch company U-Boat, revived the brand last year, and Casalegno was appointed as an ambassador for the new Exaequo due to his extensive knowledge of the original watch.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-08 09:01:10+0000

The Swiss Brand Urwerk Added Metal From a Plane to Its Watch,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/fashion/watches-urwerk-blackbird-military-airplane.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The Swiss brand Urwerk says its new timepiece is just as precise and technically advanced as the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft was. A new version of the Electro Mechanical Control watch, by Urwerk, has a crank handle and screw-down bezel made of metal that is a titanium alloy, mixed with metals such as vanadium and iron. Metal from a Lockheed SR-71 aircraft, a former military reconnaissance plane nicknamed Blackbird, is featured in a new version of Urwerk’s Electro Mechanical Control watch, scheduled to debut Aug. 21. 

The Swiss brand said the plane’s strategic purpose matched that of the timepiece: technical, user-powered precision. The original version of the watch, a mix of mechanical timepiece and a smartwatch known as the EMC, was introduced in 2013. “The EMC is more like a control board for a movement,” said Martin Frei, Urwerk’s artistic director and one of its founders. The crank handle and screw-down bezel of each Urwerk SR-71 “Blackbird” watch has been made from a section of a plane that crashed in western Texas in June 1970. 

To obtain the airplane parts, Urwerk partnered with Roman Sperl, an aerospace engineer, and Jason Sarkoyan, a watch designer and space travel enthusiast, who are the founders of Dreamland, a company that supplies aerospace parts.

Micromosaic Jewels That Tell the Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/fashion/watches-micromosaic-sicis-italy.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Hidden in the center of a ruby and diamond gardenia or tucked among three diamond doves, a watch by the Italian brand Sicis is not so much a timepiece as a micromosaic jewel that tells the time. Micromosaic is the signature of Sicis, which sets minute 0.1-millimeter tiles, or tesserae, directly onto dials to create, for example, a daisy with petals of diamond and pink sapphires or a whimsical Parisian landscape, complete with Eiffel Tower, in rubies, sapphires and colored diamonds.

The name Sicis is an acronym for a Latin phrase meaning “create your dream,” said Gioia Placuzzi, the business’s chief operating officer and creative director of its jewelry division. The company was founded in 1987 by Ms. Placuzzi’s father, Leo, who still is its chief executive, to produce high-quality mosaics for private homes and luxury hotels, including many of the Las Vegas casinos created by the billionaire developer Steve Wynn.

In 2013, Mr. Placuzzi, who collects antique jewelry, expanded the business to include jewelry with micromosaic. Its first timepiece, which debuted at the 2015 Baselworld watch trade fair in Switzerland, was a 49-millimeter automatic model called the Mystery Watch because it had no hands. Instead, a diamond rotated to indicate the hour, and a display window on the face showed the minutes.",Self Dev,New York Times,2024-08-08 09:00:33+0000

Louis Vuitton’s Montgolfière Aéro clock mixes references to the luxury house’s history with ebony wood and diamonds. The Montgolfière Aéro, an eight-piece limited edition clock, leans into the balloon motif that has appeared on Louis Vuitton leather goods and scarves. According to a Euromonitor report on 2024 global consumer trends, customers are seeking temporary escapes and delightful distractions that evoke positive feelings. 

At 34 centimeters tall, the clock has an openwork balloon shape, crafted in black ebony wood and gold-plated metal and set with more than 1,200 diamonds. The design incorporates three LV monogram flowers, one of which is set with a 9.06-carat citrine briolette, suggesting the balloon’s burner. The trunk, among the smallest that Louis Vuitton has ever produced, comes studded with diamonds for the first time. 

Michel Navas, a master watchmaker at Louis Vuitton, noted that the Montgolfière Aéro was a chance to explore larger mechanical objects, evoking the brand’s connections with travel. Designed by La Fabrique du Temps, the piece was manufactured by L’Epée 1839, a clock specialist acquired by LVMH.

U.S. Considers Breaking Up Google to Address Search Monopoly,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-monopoly-antitrust-justice-department.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The Justice Department and state attorneys general are discussing various scenarios to remedy Google’s dominance in online search, including a breakup of the company. Google was found last week to have violated antitrust law by illegally maintaining a monopoly in internet search. Now discussions over how to fix those violations have begun.

Justice Department officials are considering what remedies to ask a federal judge to order against the search giant. They are discussing various proposals, including breaking off parts of Google, such as its Chrome browser or Android smartphone operating system. Other scenarios under consideration include forcing Google to make its data available to rivals or mandating that it abandon deals that made its search engine the default option on devices like the iPhone.

The deliberations are in their early stages. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has asked the Justice Department and Google to come up with a process for determining a fix by Sept. 4. Last week’s ruling that Google was a monopolist was a landmark antitrust decision, raising serious questions about the power of tech giants in the modern internet era. The stakes are acutely high for Google, which became a $2 trillion internet juggernaut by building an online advertising business and others on top of its search engine.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-14 14:41:16+0000
California A.I. Bill Causes Alarm in Silicon Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/technology/ai-california-bill-silicon-valley.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A California bill that could impose restrictions on artificial intelligence has tech companies, investors, and activists scrambling to explain what the first-of-its-kind legislation could mean for their industry in the state. The bill is still winding its way through the state capital in Sacramento and is expected to reach the California state assembly appropriations committee before facing a vote by the full assembly. If signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the bill would require companies to test the safety of powerful A.I. technologies before releasing them to the public. It would also allow California’s attorney general to sue companies if their technologies cause serious harm, such as mass property damage or human casualties.

The debate over the A.I. bill, called SB 1047, reflects the arguments that have driven intense interest in artificial intelligence. Opponents believe it will choke the progress of technologies that promise to increase worker productivity, improve health care, and fight climate change. Supporters believe the bill will help prevent disasters and place guardrails on the work of companies that are too focused on profits. Many leading A.I. companies, including Google, Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI, would be bound by the proposed law, which could set a precedent for other states and national governments.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-14 14:15:01+0000
The Global Race to Control A.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/briefing/ai-china-us-technology.html,"This is an article by New York Times. As artificial intelligence advances, many nations are worried about being left behind. The urgency is understandable. A.I. is improving quickly and could soon reshape the global economy, automate jobs, turbocharge scientific research, and even change how wars are waged. World leaders want companies in their country to control A.I. — and they want to benefit from its power. They fear that if they do not build powerful A.I. at home, they will be left dependent on a foreign country’s creations.

So A.I. nationalism — the idea that a country must develop its own tech to serve its own interests — is spreading. Countries have enacted new laws and regulations and formed new alliances. The United States, perhaps the best positioned in the global A.I. race, is using trade policy to cut off China from key microchips. In France, the president has praised a startup focused on chatbots and other tools that excel in French and other non-English languages. Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is investing billions into A.I. development and striking deals with major tech companies to establish his country as a new hub for A.I.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-14 10:19:50+0000
Google Unveils Pixel 9 Phones to Beat Apple’s iPhone,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-pixel-9.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Google introduced its latest generation of Pixel phones, including the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Fold, aiming to enhance its presence in the competitive smartphone market. The new devices are packed with advanced artificial intelligence features, allowing users to interact with a conversational assistant, edit photos, and search for information from screenshots. This launch is part of Google's strategy to overcome consumer indifference towards its smartphones, which have struggled to gain traction against dominant players like Apple and Samsung.

Historically, Google has faced challenges in establishing itself in the hardware sector, holding only about 5 percent of the U.S. smartphone market. The company primarily generates revenue through advertising, and recent legal challenges regarding its search engine monopoly could impact its business model. In response to the growing interest in generative A.I., Google has merged its Android and Pixel development teams to better integrate A.I. into its products and streamline decision-making processes.

With these new offerings, Google hopes to leverage the excitement around A.I. to reset the competitive landscape and attract more consumers to its devices.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 20:41:24+0000
"Musk’s Trump Talk on X: After Glitchy Start, a Two-Hour Ramble",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/elon-musk-x-donald-trump.html,"This is an article by New York Times. At 8:35 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, a live audio stream on X of a conversation between Elon Musk and former President Donald J. Trump flickered to life after a 35-minute delay, but only for a moment. Mr. Trump’s mic came on, and a shuffling sound was heard before it cut out. Seven minutes later, the glitches appeared to be resolved, and the discussion began. Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump greeted each other as “Donald” and “Elon,” then chatted about immigration, the economy, and President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The two men talked for over two hours, with more than one million people listening in at the same time.

Mr. Trump congratulated Mr. Musk on the livestream’s audience, jokingly asking if he would get paid for it. The event had been billed as a triumphant moment for X, which Mr. Musk bought in 2022, as he tried to encourage Mr. Trump to return to the platform. However, the bumpy beginning showcased both the weaknesses and strengths of X under Mr. Musk.

Trump repeated a number of inaccurate claims that have become campaign staples in a conversation on Monday night with billionaire Elon Musk on X, his social media platform. After describing at length the attempted assassination against him at a rally in Pennsylvania in July, Mr. Trump ran through familiar complaints about immigration and attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris.

He inaccurately claimed that a chart he showed at the Pennsylvania rally indicated that “my last week, we had the best illegal immigration numbers,” despite the chart being misleading. He also misleadingly described Ms. Harris as “the border czar,” when she was actually responsible for addressing the root causes of migration in Central America. Trump claimed that 20 million people had illegally crossed the southern border under President Biden, a number that is overstated.

Additionally, he asserted that Mr. Biden “shut down Keystone XL pipeline,” which he claimed would have employed 48,000 people, while the projected employment was only 35 permanent jobs. He falsely described climate change as “where the ocean is going to rise one eighth of an inch over the next 400 years,” ignoring more severe projections. Trump exaggerated grocery price inflation and falsely claimed that bacon now costs “four or five times more than it did a few years ago.” 

He also claimed that the 2017 tax cut was the “largest” in history, despite several larger tax cuts existing. Lastly, he alleged that the Biden administration orchestrated the criminal cases against him, which were actually brought by state or local prosecutors.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 04:00:31+0000
X Spaces With Trump and Musk Is Off to a Glitchy Start,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/technology/trump-musk-x-spaces-interview.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Elon Musk’s live conversation with former president Donald J. Trump on X got off to a glitchy start on Monday, a setback for the social media service as Mr. Musk pushes the company to regain its dominance as an online epicenter of political discourse. Some users who tried to listen to the conversation, which was hosted on the company’s audio livestreaming feature called Spaces, were greeted by silence and an error message that read: “Details not available.” Users said they had trouble accessing the livestream on desktop computers and mobile phones. Those who were able to get the livestream to work were met with hold music.

The Spaces event was originally scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Eastern. The number of attendees fluctuated wildly as users struggled to gain access, drifting between 100,000 and more than 700,000 listeners. Mr. Musk blamed a cyberattack known as a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS, for the glitches. DDoS attacks work by flooding servers with malicious traffic and knocking them offline. “Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later,” he wrote.

"Elon Musk Is Using X to Push His Views, and Donald Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/technology/elon-musk-political-views.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Elon Musk is all in for Donald Trump’s campaign. The billionaire endorsed Mr. Trump shortly after the attempt on his life last month and has helped form a political action committee to financially support the Trump campaign. He has also bashed the former president’s political rivals online and planned to host a live appearance with Mr. Trump on X, his social media platform.

With more than 193 million followers, Musk's account is the biggest on the platform, filled with praise for Trump and increased attacks on President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. By endorsing a presidential candidate, Musk has broken with other heads of social media companies who typically avoid public endorsements. 

Musk hasn’t always been so outspoken about his political opinions, as SpaceX and Tesla have benefited from government contracts and incentives. However, as these companies have become more dominant, Musk has faced less pressure to appease political leaders. His use of X as a political megaphone has led to speculation about stifling accounts that promote Democratic causes.

The European Union has placed restrictions on social media companies under the Digital Services Act, opening an inquiry into whether X has violated the act. Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner, warned Musk about moderating misinformation during the livestream with Trump, while X’s CEO Linda Yaccarino pushed back against claims of political bias on the platform.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-12 19:46:00+0000

He followed it up with several posts, including one that said, “Are you better off now than you were when I was president? Our economy is shattered. Our border has been erased. We’re a nation in decline.”

Mr. Trump’s return to X after nearly a year of silence could provide a needed boost to the platform, which has faced increased competition from a rash of new social media platforms, including the former president’s Truth Social. X has also struggled to overcome skepticism from advertisers, especially after Mr. Musk sued an influential advertising coalition last week. If Mr. Trump returns as a power user of the site, it could attract new interest from political advertisers.

During his time in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump used the site as a megaphone to issue policy directives and pummel his rivals. Mr. Trump was banned from X, then known as Twitter, in 2021 after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of the election.

Brands love when social media stars take to Instagram or TikTok to advertise their products, but many are eager to avoid influencers who discuss politics. This has become a challenging task in the unpredictable influencer industry, especially with the presidential election approaching.

Captiv8, a marketing firm, has introduced a tool that analyzes mentions of social media stars in online articles to determine their potential political engagement. This tool assigns letter grades to creators based on their posts and media coverage, with an ""A"" indicating safety and a ""C"" suggesting caution. Categories considered include sensitive social issues, hate speech, and explicit content.

Uber has spent millions trying to get a proposal on the Nevada ballot that would restrict the legal fees that bankroll many lawsuits against companies. The company is seeking to place a measure on Nevada’s ballot that would drastically limit the amount of money that lawyers could collect when they brought successful lawsuits. If the measure passes, it will make it less attractive — and in some cases financially impractical — for plaintiffs’ lawyers to file such suits.

The initiative is being spearheaded by Nevadans for Fair Recovery, a political action committee created this year by Uber and its lobbyists. The company has put $5 million into the PAC and is its only financial backer. The PAC has presented the measure as a way to protect people from trial lawyers who are “getting rich at the expense of plaintiffs and everyone else.” 

This proposal reflects a long-standing desire in corporate America to make it harder for aggrieved customers and workers to file lawsuits against companies seeking compensation for alleged injuries and mistreatment.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-12 18:37:31+0000
How Has Tech Changed Your School Experience? We Want to Hear About It.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/technology/phone-tech-use-schools.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Some states are banning phones in schools to reduce classroom distraction and cyberbullying. Digital devices and apps can be great tools in schools, but they can also be a classroom distraction or even a weapon. Some students spend so much class time on their smartphones, commenting on social media or texting their friends, that it hampers their learning. Additionally, some school children and teenagers have used their phones to bully or sexually exploit their classmates, or post videos of student fights on social media. Classroom devices like Chromebooks and iPads, while helpful, can also enable distractions and facilitate problems like bullying.

To better understand tech use and misuse in schools, I’d like to hear from teachers, students, parents, and school administrators about your experiences. I will read each submission and may use your contact information to follow up with you. I will not publish any details you share without contacting you and verifying your information.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-11 09:03:15+0000
Why Schools Are Racing to Ban Student Phones,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/technology/school-phone-bans-indiana-louisiana.html,"This is an article by New York Times. As the new school year starts, a wave of new laws that aim to curb distracted learning is taking effect in Indiana, Louisiana, and other states. Cellphones have become a school scourge, with more than 70 percent of high school teachers stating that student phone distraction is a “major problem,” according to a recent Pew Research survey. This has prompted states to mount a bipartisan effort to crack down on rampant student cellphone use, with at least eight states passing laws or adopting rules to limit phone use during school hours.

The issue extends beyond mere distraction; students have used their phones to bully, sexually exploit, and share videos of physical attacks on peers. However, enforcing cellphone restrictions can be challenging for teachers without schoolwide rules requiring students to place their phones in lockers or designated areas. In response, state lawmakers and some governors are advocating for more uniform restrictions in public schools to address these concerns effectively.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-11 09:00:49+0000
Elon Musk to Speak to West Point Cadets,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/politics/elon-musk-west-point.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media platform X and Tesla’s chief executive, will deliver the keynote speech at the annual convocation of the United States Military Academy next Friday, West Point officials said. The speech is billed as a “fireside chat,” and attendance for West Point cadets and faculty is not mandatory. The event will be part of the academic year’s intellectual theme, “The Human and the Machine: Leadership on the Emerging Battlefield,” according to a statement provided by the academy.

Mr. Musk’s company SpaceX handles launch services for spy and command-and-control satellites for the Pentagon and provides internet service for Ukraine. Last month, Mr. Musk broke with a pattern set by the leaders of other major social media firms by endorsing a presidential candidate. In recent years, Mr. Musk has been criticized for embracing conspiracy theories and for his strident positions in cultural debates.

Retired Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton, a West Point graduate and senior adviser to VoteVets, criticized his alma mater’s move, stating, “Elon Musk is not a thought leader. He is far from the example we should be elevating at our military academies.”",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-09 20:48:04+0000
Former Twitter Board Member Sues Elon Musk’s X For $20 Million in Pay,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/technology/elon-musk-x-twitter-board-lawsuit.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A former Twitter board member, Omid Kordestani, sued the social media company owned by Elon Musk, claiming that Musk refused to cash out more than $20 million worth of shares. Kordestani, who joined Twitter’s board in 2015 and helped oversee the sale of the company to Musk in 2022, received most of his compensation in stock. The lawsuit alleges that after Musk acquired the company, now called X, he did not pay Kordestani for those shares.

The suit, filed in California Superior Court in San Francisco, states that X “seeks to reap the benefits of Mr. Kordestani’s seven years of service to Twitter without paying him for it.” A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This public dispute is unusual, as most boardroom conflicts are typically resolved quietly. 

Kordestani's lawsuit marks him as the most senior Twitter leader to take legal action against Musk, following other former executives who have also sued the company for unpaid compensation. These former executives have accused Musk of withholding severance payments that were owed after the acquisition, as he laid off thousands of employees and offered limited severance packages.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-09 20:16:27+0000

People who have used Cash App accounts may be entitled to receive up to $2,500 each as part of a $15 million settlement related to a data breach involving the popular payments and investment platform. The exposure of sensitive information for more than eight million users of Cash App Investing was revealed in a regulatory filing in 2022 by Block, its parent company. The data was exposed when a former employee downloaded corporate reports after leaving the company.

A second breach involving more customers took place in 2023 with Cash App’s person-to-person payment services after the defendants failed to take security measures. It was alleged that Block and Cash App were negligent in allowing unauthorized access to personal identification information and mishandled complaints about the breaches and fraudulent transactions.

The proposed settlement agreement, filed in March, allows holders of Cash App accounts from Aug. 23, 2018, through Aug. 20, 2024, to submit a claim for out-of-pocket losses of up to $2,500. Block and Cash App have denied any wrongdoing, stating that the settlement is not an admission of liability. The deadline to submit claims is Nov. 18, with a final court hearing set for Dec. 16.

Block has previously stated that the disclosed information included customers’ names and Cash App brokerage account numbers, but did not include user names, passwords, Social Security numbers, or other personally identifiable details.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-09 18:52:30+0000
Google’s Monopoly Money + Is the A.I. Bubble Popping? + The Hot-Mess Express,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/podcasts/hardfork-google-antitrust-ai-bubble.html,"This is an article by New York Times. This week, Google lost a significant antitrust case, with a federal judge ruling that it maintains an illegal monopoly in search. Judge Amit Mehta's 277-page decision concluded that Google has acted as a monopolist, primarily through exclusive agreements with companies like Apple and Samsung to be the default search engine. This ruling is seen as a major victory for the Department of Justice, which has been pursuing antitrust actions against Google for years. The judge found that these agreements had anti-competitive effects, limiting innovation and harming competitors.

The ruling raises questions about the future of Google and the tech industry, as it could lead to remedies that might disrupt Google's dominance. The judge has yet to determine the specific remedies, which could include structural changes like breaking up the company or behavioral changes to its practices. Meanwhile, discussions about whether we are in an AI bubble have intensified, with concerns about unsustainable spending and the potential for a slowdown in AI progress.

China Battery Tech Reflects Research Boom and Big Spending,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/business/china-ev-battery-tech.html,"This is an article by New York Times. China’s domination of electric cars, which is threatening to start a trade war, was born decades ago in university laboratories in Texas, when researchers discovered how to make batteries with minerals that were abundant and cheap. Companies from China have recently built on those early discoveries, figuring out how to make the batteries hold a powerful charge and endure more than a decade of daily recharges. They are inexpensively and reliably manufacturing vast numbers of these batteries, producing most of the world’s electric cars and many other clean energy systems.

Batteries are just one example of how China is catching up with — or passing — advanced industrial democracies in its technological and manufacturing sophistication. It is achieving many breakthroughs in a long list of sectors, from pharmaceuticals to drones to high-efficiency solar panels. Beijing’s challenge to the technological leadership that the United States has held since World War II is evidenced in China’s classrooms and corporate budgets, as well as in directives from the highest levels of the Communist Party.

A considerably larger share of Chinese students major in science, math and engineering than students in other big countries do. That share is rising further, even as overall higher education enrollment has increased more than tenfold since 2000. Spending on research and development has surged, tripling in the past decade and moving China into second place after the United States. Researchers in China lead the world in publishing widely cited papers in 52 of 64 critical technologies, recent calculations by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute reveal.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-09 08:39:23+0000

The Global Alliance for Responsible Media will dissolve after Elon Musk accused the group of orchestrating a boycott against X, his social media platform. The nonprofit coalition, which includes major advertisers, informed its members that it would cease operations following a lawsuit from X claiming that the group violated antitrust laws by coordinating with brands to discourage advertising on the platform. Although the World Federation of Advertisers, which leads GARM, denied any legal wrongdoing, it acknowledged that GARM lacked the financial resources to continue while facing legal challenges.

Stephan Loerke, the chief executive of the World Federation of Advertisers, expressed confidence in their adherence to competition rules but stated that GARM would shut down immediately.

"Why Google, Microsoft and Amazon Shy Away From Buying A.I. Start-Ups",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/technology/ai-start-ups-google-microsoft-amazon.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have engaged in deals with A.I. start-ups to acquire their technology and top employees without purchasing the companies outright. For instance, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, founders of Character.AI, recently returned to Google after raising nearly $200 million for their chatbot start-up. Instead of acquiring Character.AI, Google opted to pay $3 billion to license its technology, with a significant portion allocated to buy out the shareholders. This approach reflects a trend among major tech firms to avoid direct acquisitions, which could attract regulatory scrutiny.

These companies are under close examination by agencies like the Federal Trade Commission regarding their competitive practices, including the acquisition of start-ups. By licensing technology and hiring key personnel, they can effectively integrate the start-ups' assets while sidestepping ownership. Experts suggest that these arrangements resemble traditional acquisitions despite the companies' efforts to present them differently. This strategy allows tech giants to advance in the A.I. sector while navigating the complexities of regulatory oversight.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-08 14:40:39+0000
"From Tips to TikTok, Trump Swaps Policies With Aim to Please Voters",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/us/politics/trump-tax-tips-tiktok-crypto.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The former president’s economic agenda has made some notable reversals from the policies he pushed while in the White House. From TikTok to cryptocurrencies, Donald J. Trump has been reinventing his platform on the fly as he aims to attract new swaths of voters. During a Bitcoin conference in Nashville in July, he expressed a desire for America to become the “crypto capital of the planet.” At his convention speech last month, Trump declared that his new economic agenda would include eliminating taxes on tips, claiming it would uplift the middle class and provide relief to hospitality workers. 

While the cost and feasibility of this idea have been questioned by economists, labor experts noted the irony of Trump’s reversal, as he previously attempted to take tips away from workers. This shift underscores his malleability in election-year policymaking, as he aims to differentiate himself from Vice President Kamala Harris and please crowds. Observers have pointed out that Trump is now posing as a champion of tipped workers, despite his record of slashing protections for them. In 2017, his Labor Department proposed changes that would allow employers to collect tips and use them at their discretion, which could lead to workers losing their tips.",Science & Technology,New York Times,2024-08-13 12:08:20+0000

Trump’s social network is increasingly relying on a niche of the ad market that caters to hard-core Trump fans and Christian conservatives for revenue. Trump Media, which owns Truth Social, gains revenue from ads placed by right-wing merchants with relatively small ad budgets. Days after an assassination attempt on Trump, Ben Wolfgram, president of a glassware business, advertised a whiskey tumbler with a bullet sticking out of it on Truth Social after Facebook removed his ad for violating its policies. His ads were seen more than one million times on Truth Social, which he described as “a lot more lenient.”

Five months after going public, Trump Media & Technology Group has revealed little about its business plans. An examination found that the company is increasingly reliant on revenue from a niche market catering to Trump loyalists. This has created a closed-loop ecosystem that contrasts with larger social networks, which run ads from major corporations.

The Justice Department and state attorneys general are discussing various scenarios to remedy Google’s dominance in online search, including a breakup of the company. Google was found last week to have violated antitrust law by illegally maintaining a monopoly in internet search. Now discussions over how to fix those violations have begun.

Justice Department officials are considering what remedies to ask a federal judge to order against the search giant. They are discussing various proposals, including breaking off parts of Google, such as its Chrome browser or Android smartphone operating system. Other scenarios under consideration include forcing Google to make its data available to rivals or mandating that it abandon deals that made its search engine the default option on devices like the iPhone.

The deliberations are in their early stages. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has asked the Justice Department and Google to come up with a process for determining a fix by Sept. 4.

Texas Sues General Motors for Collecting and Selling Driver Data,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/gm-texas-lawsuit.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The state of Texas sued General Motors on Tuesday, accusing the automaker of collecting detailed driving data on 16 million drivers and selling it to insurance companies without their consent. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stated that millions of drivers expected to buy a car, not a surveillance system that unlawfully records their driving information. The lawsuit follows an investigation initiated after reports revealed that General Motors and other automakers had sold extensive records of customers' driving behaviors, which led to increased insurance premiums for many. 

General Motors indicated that it was reviewing the complaint and had been in discussions with the attorney general’s office, expressing a shared desire to protect consumer privacy. The lawsuit claims that since 2015, G.M. sold driving data to vendors like LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Verisk Analytics, which then calculated driving scores for insurers. Customers were often enrolled in the data collection program through a deceptive sales process at dealerships, with disclosures buried in lengthy documents. 

The lawsuit seeks a court order for G.M. to destroy all collected driving data and restitution for affected customers, including 1.8 million Texans. Additionally, two Democratic senators have urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the auto industry's data collection practices.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 01:14:04+0000

Tubi has exploded in popularity over the last 18 months, establishing itself as one of the most popular streaming services in the United States. It now consistently outranks Peacock, Max, Paramount+, and Apple TV+ in total viewing time, according to Nielsen, and is drawing even with Disney+. The streaming service, owned by the Fox Corporation, operates on a different business model by being free and generating revenue through advertising, without requiring an account to use. This approach has led to greater engagement compared to competitors like Roku and Pluto.

Anjali Sud, Tubi’s chief executive, likened the service to ""the little engine"" that is continuously improving. Its rise has surprised many competitors and investors, especially since Tubi does not allocate large budgets for original programming or premium sports rights. Instead, its library consists of tens of thousands of older shows and movies, including classics like the 1970s procedural “Columbo” and the early 2000s sitcom “Everybody Hates Chris.” Initially, many consumers were skeptical about Tubi's legitimacy, questioning whether it was a scam or if it could harm their devices.

Starbucks announced that Brian Niccol, the chief executive of Chipotle Mexican Grill, will replace Laxman Narasimhan, who is leaving after just over a year in the role. Niccol has been at the helm of Chipotle since 2018 and will take over at Starbucks next month, also assuming the position of board chairman. The leadership change comes as Starbucks faces slowing sales, a declining stock price, and pressure from activist investors. 

Starbucks' stock surged more than 21 percent in morning trading following the announcement. The company has been struggling with weakening results in key markets, particularly in the United States and China, leading to a more than 20 percent drop in shares since Narasimhan took over. Activist investment groups, including Elliott Investment Management and Starboard Value, have begun pushing for changes within the company.

He planned to reopen the W Hotel, which was a key source of tourism jobs in Vieques, using his crypto wealth to restore both the property and the local economy.

Despite his ambitions, the revival of the hotel has become an illusion, plagued by unpaid bills and legal issues.

At 8:35 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, a live audio stream on X of a conversation between Elon Musk and former President Donald J.

Seven minutes later, the glitches appeared to be resolved, and the discussion began. Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump greeted each other as “Donald” and “Elon,” then chatted about immigration, the economy, and President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The two men talked for over two hours with more than one million people listening in.

Mr. Trump congratulated Mr. Musk about the livestream’s audience, jokingly asking if he would get paid for it. The event had been billed as a triumphant moment for the platform, which Mr. Musk bought in 2022, as he tried to woo Mr. Trump back to X after his reinstatement.

"Private REITS Were a Hot Investment Trend, but They’ve Lost Some Appeal",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/business/private-reit-redemptions.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Drawn by the opportunity to invest with private equity firms, small investors rushed into real estate investment trusts (REITs). However, these funds have lost some appeal as interest rates have climbed. The private equity firms began to seek out smaller investors almost a decade ago, marking a significant shift for firms like Blackstone and KKR that had previously relied on large institutional investors. This change allowed fund managers to grow their assets and increase fees.

For individual investors, the chance to invest with Wall Street’s elite was enticing, despite the challenges posed by withdrawal limits during tough times. The allure of private equity was bolstered by strong track records, particularly during the 2008 financial crisis. Private REITs, which own commercial properties and pay substantial dividends, became particularly popular. From 2017 to mid-2024, these private REITs raised over $110 billion, thriving when interest rates were near zero.

However, the landscape shifted in 2022 when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, diminishing the appeal of these investments.

Organizers of the Games, desperate for that cash, appeared to have said yes at every turn. The medals were made by the LVMH-owned jeweler Chaumet, the French parade uniforms by Berluti, and the medal trays bore the unmistakable checkerboard pattern of Louis Vuitton.

Antoine Arnault, Bernard Arnault’s son, hinted at a “big surprise” involving the company. This surprise was hard to miss during the parade of athletes, where one vessel carried suitcases and trunks encased in Louis Vuitton leather. The audacious segment effectively served as a three-minute advertisement for LVMH during one of the most anticipated events of the Games, leaving some longtime Olympic executives slack-jawed.

It also outraged several of the International Olympic Committee’s top partners, billion-dollar companies that have been involved with the Games for far longer than LVMH.

Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, were down more than 2.5 percent in early trading on Wednesday morning on news that the Justice Department is considering breaking up the technology giant for maintaining an illegal search monopoly. This potential move could have significant ramifications for the broader tech sector, as companies like Apple, Amazon, and Meta are also facing their own antitrust challenges.

In a recent ruling, Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia agreed with the government and multiple states that Google’s dominance in search was constraining competition. Google has announced plans to appeal this ruling. Mehta has requested both parties to submit suggested remedies by September 4, with a hearing scheduled for two days later.

One of the remedies being discussed is the dismantling of Google, which could involve separating its Chrome web browser or Android smartphone operating system as a penalty for its illegal monopoly in search. This would mark the most significant antitrust ruling against a tech company since the efforts targeting Microsoft over two decades ago, which ultimately slowed Microsoft’s dominance and allowed new rivals, including Google, to emerge.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 14:04:09+0000

Vice President Kamala Harris’s sudden ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has generated a host of questions about her economic agenda, including how much she will stick to the details of President Biden’s positions, tweak them, or chart entirely new ones. When she begins to roll out her policy vision this week, Ms. Harris is likely to answer only some of those questions. During an economy-focused speech on Friday in Raleigh, N.C., Ms. Harris will outline a sort of reboot of the administration’s economic agenda, according to four people familiar with Ms. Harris’s plans.

She will lay out an approach relatively light on details, shifting emphasis from Mr. Biden’s focus on job creation and made-in-America manufacturing toward efforts to rein in the cost of living. However, it will rarely break from Mr. Biden on substance. This strategy reflects the advice economic aides have given Ms. Harris: to be clear and bold in talking about the economy, but not overly specific. Her ability to do that has been effectively enabled by the unusual circumstances of Mr. Biden’s abrupt departure from the presidential race, which allowed Ms. Harris to secure the Democratic nomination without enduring a long primary campaign.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 12:14:46+0000

Mars, the company behind M&M’s and Snickers, has agreed to acquire Kellanova, the snack food business spun off by Kellogg’s last year, in a multibillion-dollar deal that will create a new global food giant. The acquisition, one of the largest food deals in years, values Kellanova at $35.9 billion, including debt, a hefty premium to the company’s market value before news of the deal first began to leak. Kellanova owns a large menu of brands including Cheez-It, Pringles, and Eggo.

Mars, which is privately owned and best known for its chocolate candies, has tried to broaden beyond sweets. In 2020, it bought Kind North America, the company that makes Kind Bars. Acquiring Kellanova would allow Mars to offer an array of both salty and sweet food, echoing a strategy that Hershey employed with its acquisition of the parent company of SkinnyPop and Dot’s Pretzels.

“In welcoming Kellanova’s portfolio of growing global brands, we have a substantial opportunity for Mars to further develop a sustainable snacking business that is fit for the future,” said Poul Weihrauch, the chief executive of Mars.

It is the height of the summer travel season: Airplanes and cruises are packed, hotels are booked, and travelers are crowding theme parks and attractions. Yet throughout the United States, Covid-19 is currently circulating at very high levels. During the peak of the pandemic, masks were ubiquitous in hotels, airports, and other public places. Since the end of the mandate, most travelers have abandoned preventive measures, particularly masks. With updated vaccines not available until the fall, experts are reminding travelers about the benefits of masking, particularly in airports and poorly ventilated indoor environments.

The number of reported cases appears to be climbing both in the United States and abroad. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates “very high” levels of the virus in wastewater samples nationwide. People who want to minimize their risk of respiratory illnesses like Covid should wear a mask while traveling. A high-quality mask, like an N95, KN95, or KF94, is recommended, as these filter out the overwhelming majority of virus particles and are far more effective at reducing the chance of a Covid infection than cloth or surgical versions. Masks should fit snugly on your face.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:03:32+0000
Inflation Report Is Next Hurdle for Stock Markets Shaken by Volatility,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/inflation-stock-market.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Wall Street is on edge heading into the July consumer price report after sharp stock swings this month reignited fears over the fate of the economy. Economists are predicting that inflation remained broadly unchanged in July — a reading that should allow the Federal Reserve to start easing the brakes on the economy next month by cutting interest rates. However, a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the Consumer Price Index could intensify worries that the economy is moving quickly toward a more pronounced downturn, while a surprise acceleration is likely to rein in rate cut expectations that investors are already counting on to support the market.

This leaves investors in search of an inflation “sweet spot,” according to Chris Larkin, head of trading and investing at E-Trade. The S&P 500 abruptly fell 3 percent on Aug. 5 — its worst day in almost two years. Although it rebounded and recouped its losses, the jolt has left investors braced for further turbulence. Some analysts are less concerned, pointing to inflation data that showed producer prices slowing more than expected, helping the S&P 500 to rise 1.7 percent for the day.

However, other factors are intensifying the market’s vulnerability to swings in response to unexpected data points about the economy, including a slow buildup of risky bets and concern about whether the rally in shares of big tech companies has gone too far. This backdrop leaves the market susceptible to volatility when unexpected events occur.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:03:12+0000
"To Save the Panama Canal From Drought, a Disruptive Fix",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html,"This is an article by New York Times. In the wake of a drought that hampered shipping, the Panama Canal’s overseers are eager to expand water storage. Climate change leaves them no choice. Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, the administrator of the Panama Canal, is obsessed with water and constantly monitors the fluctuating level of Lake Gatún, the artificial reservoir that is the centerpiece of the canal system. Last year, a drought dropped the lake to critical levels, prompting canal authorities to limit traffic. At the worst point, only 22 ships a day were allowed to pass through the canal, down from the usual 36 to 38, leaving more than 160 ships stuck at anchor.

Rains that began in May have allowed the lifting of most restrictions, with an average of 35 ships a day making the journey in recent weeks. However, canal authorities recognize this as merely a respite in a new era influenced by climate change and frequent periods of El Niño, when ocean temperatures rise and rainfall decreases. They are consumed with the need to expand water storage to ensure the canal's operational viability in the future.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 08:55:33+0000
Hunter Biden Sought State Department Help for Burisma,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/us/politics/hunter-biden-ukrainian-company.html,"This is an article by New York Times. After President Biden dropped his re-election bid, his administration released records showing that while he was vice president, his son solicited U.S. government assistance. Hunter Biden sought assistance from the U.S. government for a potentially lucrative energy project in Italy while his father was vice president, according to newly released records and interviews. The records indicate that Hunter Biden wrote at least one letter to the U.S. ambassador to Italy in 2016 seeking assistance for the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, where he was a board member.

Embassy officials appear to have been uneasy with the request from the son of the sitting vice president on behalf of a foreign company. A Commerce Department official based in the U.S. Embassy in Rome expressed caution, stating, “I want to be careful about promising too much.” The official noted that the U.S. government should not be actively advocating with the government of Italy without the company going through the Department of Commerce Advocacy Center.

Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Biden, stated that his client “asked various people,” including the U.S. ambassador to Italy at the time, whether they could arrange an introduction between Burisma and the president of the Tuscany region of Italy, where Burisma was pursuing a geothermal project.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 00:27:13+0000
Ohio Officer Is Charged With Murder in Shooting of Pregnant Black Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/us/ohio-officer-takiya-young-murder.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Connor Grubb, 29, of the Blendon Township Police Department faces multiple charges in the fatal shooting of Ta’Kiya Young, 21, who was shot in her car outside a Kroger last year after being accused of theft. A police officer in Ohio was indicted on Tuesday on murder charges in the fatal shooting last year of a pregnant Black woman in the parking lot of a supermarket. The officer faces four counts each of murder and felonious assault and two counts of involuntary manslaughter, according to Franklin County court records. The charges came nearly a year after Young was shot in her car after a store worker accused her of stealing bottles of alcohol, an incident that drew protests and investigations.

Police body-camera footage from August 24, 2023, showed two officers approach Young’s vehicle and instruct her not to leave. The video shows Young turning the wheel, and the car inches forward, appearing to hit a police officer. One of the officers then fired a single shot through the windshield, striking Young. She later died at a hospital, and her unborn fetus did not survive. Officer Grubb was scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday afternoon in Columbus, Ohio. His lawyers stated that evidence will show his actions were justified, claiming that video shows he was hit by the vehicle.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-13 22:12:12+0000

Brian Niccol will replace Laxman Narasimhan and begin leading Starbucks next month. Starbucks unveiled an abrupt leadership change on Tuesday, with Mr. Niccol, a high-profile name in the restaurant industry, taking the reins after months of weak sales and a falling stock price. The company’s chief financial officer, Rachel Ruggeri, will serve as interim chief executive until Mr. Niccol officially joins on Sept. 9. Following the announcement, Starbucks’ shares soared about 20 percent, as investors, including activist groups, largely cheered the leadership pivot.

Mr. Niccol is coming off of six years at the helm of Chipotle Mexican Grill, a period that saw the fast-casual burrito chain nearly double its sales. The company’s stock price has increased about 800 percent since he took over in early 2018. Much of that growth has stemmed from Mr. Niccol’s focus on opening more drive-through options and expanding the company’s loyalty program.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-13 18:57:05+0000
Consumer Protection Agency Cracks Down on Seller-Backed Home Sales,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/consumer-protection-home-sales.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A federal regulator signaled it would take a tougher stance with seller-financed home sales on Tuesday, saying that they were subject to many of the same consumer protections as a home bought with a more traditional mortgage. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released an advisory opinion that put sellers on notice that it would not tolerate the predatory practices that have come to dominate the so-called contract for deed market. These seller-backed sales have become popular in poor neighborhoods with rundown single-family homes, where mortgages are hard to come by.

Contract for deeds are multiyear installment contracts in which the seller retains the title to a home until the buyer makes a final payment. These risky deals often have above-market interest rates and put the burden of repairs on the would-be buyer. The regulator made clear that contract for deed sales were subject to federal truth in lending laws that required sellers to first assess a person’s ability to buy a home as well as provide full disclosure of the risks and hidden costs associated with these deals.

“The government is taking action to ensure that these products do not turn the dream of homeownership into a nightmare,” said Rohit Chopra, the C.F.P.B. director. The C.F.P.B. also released a research report documenting the market’s abusive practices, noting that a buyer can be evicted for missing a single monthly payment and builds up no equity in the home. More recently, contract for deed sellers have targeted ethnic and religious communities, prompting the C.F.P.B. to release its advisory opinion in conjunction with a hearing in St. Paul, Minn.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-13 19:15:36+0000
How Food Prices Have Changed During the Biden Administration,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/economy/inflation-food-prices.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A central issue has plagued the Biden administration for most of its term: the steep rise in grocery prices. Polls have consistently found that inflation remains a top concern for voters, who have seen their budgets squeezed. A YouGov poll published last month found that 64 percent of Americans said inflation was a “very serious problem.” When it comes to inflation, several surveys suggested that Americans were most concerned about grocery prices.

Despite the gloom about grocery costs, food price increases have generally been cooling for months. Economists in a Bloomberg survey think that inflation overall probably climbed by 3 percent from a year earlier, in line with a 3 percent rise in June. Some voters have blamed President Biden for rising prices, pointing out that food costs have soared over the past four years. In the year through June, grocery prices rose 1.1 percent, a significant slowdown from a recent peak of 13.5 percent in August 2022. Compared with four years ago, grocery prices are up about 20 percent.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-13 17:25:29+0000
Transfers and Pay Cuts: Pregnant Officers Accuse Border Agency of Discrimination,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/us/politics/customs-border-protection-pregnant-lawsuit.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Under a $45 million settlement, Customs and Border Protection agreed to adjust its policy around pregnancy. Some women say the agency has instilled a culture of shame and perpetuated a fear of retaliation. Roberta Gabaldon, an agriculture specialist in El Paso, was told she needed to be reassigned to a post with fewer responsibilities during her pregnancy. Her experience reflects that of hundreds of female employees at the agency who have filed suit against Customs and Border Protection, claiming they were denied equal treatment once they disclosed their pregnancies. Many were transferred to administrative or secretarial work, which hurt their opportunities for advancement and led to pay cuts due to the loss of overtime. The settlement requires C.B.P. to draft a new policy for pregnant women, with oversight from the lawyers representing the women for three years. C.B.P. will also be required to train all managers and supervisors about the rights of pregnant employees. The agency declined to comment on its policy as described in the lawsuit, citing its practice of not commenting on pending litigation.

Nneka Ogwumike, a nine-time All-Star and president of the W.N.B.A. players union, will take over the leadership of More Than a Vote, a nonprofit organization founded by LeBron James in 2020. This fall, the organization will shift its focus to women's reproductive rights. Ogwumike emphasized the importance of educating people about various aspects of women's freedoms, including family planning and birth control, stating, “There’s just a lot that’s at stake.”

More Than a Vote was established in response to nationwide protests following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, with athletes like James aiming to leverage their platforms for social change. Initially, the organization concentrated on protecting voting access for Black voters and raised approximately $4.2 million in 2020. However, it has been largely inactive in recent years.

Ogwumike, who volunteered as a poll worker in 2020, began discussions with James this year about the growing prominence of reproductive rights and the increased attention on women’s sports.

Starbucks, the struggling coffee chain, is getting its third C.E.O. in the past 18 months. Laxman Narasimhan is out as the C.E.O. of Starbucks, a year and a half since he succeeded Howard Schultz. Narasimhan will be replaced by Brian Niccol, a fast-food industry veteran who executed a turnaround as C.E.O. of Chipotle. Starbucks shares have fallen more than 20 percent since Narasimhan took the reins, hurt by slowing sales in the U.S. and China. The company has faced dueling activist investor campaigns and criticism from Schultz. Starbucks’ stock jumped more than 14 percent in premarket trading after the announcement. Mellody Hobson will stay on the board as lead independent director but cede her role as chairwoman.

Paramount Lays Off 15 Percent of U.S. Employees,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/paramount-layoffs-skydance.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Paramount, the parent company of CBS, Nickelodeon, and MTV, announced on Tuesday that it will cut its U.S. workforce by approximately 15 percent as part of a series of long-scheduled job reductions. The company's three co-chief executives stated that these layoffs, which will impact thousands of employees, are necessary due to shifts in the entertainment industry. They emphasized that Paramount is at an inflection point and must make changes to strengthen its business.

The cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce annual costs by about $500 million and are expected to be largely completed by the end of September. This announcement comes as Paramount prepares for its merger with Skydance, a Hollywood studio known for hits like “Top Gun: Maverick.” The merger is backed by significant financial investment from the Ellison family, which includes $8 billion in capital.

In addition to the merger, Paramount is exploring other options during a 45-day “go shop” period to see if other bidders will surpass Skydance’s offer. Despite reporting profitability in its streaming business, Paramount+ recently lost 2.8 million subscribers, attributed to a change in a bundle agreement in South Korea. The media industry has seen a trend of mergers leading to job reductions, and traditional media companies continue to face skepticism from investors regarding the profitability of streaming compared to cable.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-13 12:30:20+0000
Hot Summer Threatens Efficacy of Mail-Order Medications,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/health/heat-mail-order-drugs.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The temperatures inside delivery trucks can reach twice the recommended threshold, but federal rules on drug storage conditions do not apply to the booming world of mail-order delivery. Medications like Toujeo, used to treat Type 2 diabetes, are intended to be stored at temperatures below 86 degrees, yet many patients receive their doses through the mail during the summer heat. Melted capsules, cloudy insulin, and pills that may no longer work are becoming common concerns.

Doctors and pharmacists warn that the scorching temperatures could be endangering people’s health by overheating their medications. Millions of Americans now rely on mail-order shipments for their prescriptions, but the cargo areas of delivery trucks can reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, far exceeding the recommended range of 68 to 77 degrees. While mail-order pharmacies claim their packaging is weather resistant and take precautions for temperature-sensitive medications, a study found that packages spent more than two-thirds of their transit time outside the appropriate temperature range.

Extreme temperatures can alter the components in many medications, including insulin and oral contraceptives. Liquid medications are particularly at risk of degradation due to excessive heat, which can cause the evaporation of critical components.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-13 19:06:05+0000
Salmon Farms in Patagonia Face Growing Opposition,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/science/chile-salmon-farms-patagonia.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The Chilean industry’s expansion has drawn repeated challenges from environmentalists and Indigenous people of the region, prompting calls for a moratorium. The sea is calm as dusk descends on Tarsicio Antezana’s home island of Quinchao in southern Chile. In the distance, snow-capped volcanoes turn a deep violet with the setting sun. However, Mr. Antezana cannot ignore the strip of small, rectangular objects in the water, which are salmon farms. Below the surface, high-density net cages teem with thousands of salmon, common in Los Lagos, the primary aquaculture region in Chile. The country is the top exporter of farmed salmon to the United States, but these fish are not native, leading to complaints about ecological damage and threats to wildlife. Large-scale salmon farming began in Chile in the 1970s, and Mr. Antezana was involved in evaluating its viability. Over four decades, he has witnessed the industry grow into a leading producer, with farmed salmon becoming Chile’s second-largest export, generating $6.5 billion in revenue last year. U.S. consumers play a significant role in this success, with record consumption of Chilean salmon in 2022.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-13 07:00:29+0000
Can This Country Show Europe How to Compete Again?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/business/sweden-economy-europe-competitiveness.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Sweden’s economy has, in many ways, suffered from the same tribulations as the rest of Europe: recent bouts of crushing inflation and recession, and now the prospect of meager growth in a world split by geopolitical and economic conflict. Nevertheless, the Nordic country has a roster of high-tech entrepreneurs that is the envy of its neighbors. Spotify and Skype are globally recognized brand names. Klarna, a financial tech firm, and King Digital Entertainment, the maker of the video game juggernaut Candy Crush, are other examples of homegrown tech powerhouses.

“They have something — particularly in the tech sector — which other European countries do not really have to the same extent,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. That entrepreneurial track record has been attracting renewed attention at a time when anxieties are mounting about Europe’s ability to compete with American and Chinese advancements in high technology.

Elon Musk’s live conversation with former president Donald J. Trump on X got off to a glitchy start on Monday, a setback for the social media service as Mr. Musk pushes the company to regain its dominance as an online epicenter of political discourse. Some users who tried to listen to the conversation, which was hosted on the company’s audio livestreaming feature called Spaces, were greeted by silence and an error message that read: “Details not available.” Users said they had trouble accessing the livestream on desktop computers and mobile phones. Those who were able to get the livestream to work were met with hold music.

The Spaces event was originally scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Eastern. The number of attendees fluctuated wildly as users struggled to gain access, drifting between 100,000 and more than 700,000 listeners. Mr. Musk blamed a cyberattack known as a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS, for the glitches. DDoS attacks work by flooding servers with malicious traffic and knocking them offline. “Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later,” he wrote.

The New York Times editorial board will no longer make endorsements in New York elections, including races for governor and mayor of New York City. This change is effective immediately, meaning the paper will not take a stance in upcoming Senate, congressional, or state legislative races this fall, nor in next year’s New York City elections. Kathleen Kingsbury, The Times’s Opinion editor, stated that the institution remains “rooted in New York City” and will continue to provide perspective on the races and candidates.

The editorial board, which has endorsed candidates since 1860, will still endorse presidential candidates. This decision aligns with a broader trend among news outlets moving away from political endorsements, as seen with Alden Global Capital and The Baltimore Sun. The Times has also reduced the frequency of its editorials, focusing on significant matters.

The editorial board's endorsements have historically influenced local political contests, with candidates often strategizing to win their support.

Three MDMA Studies Are Retracted by Scientific Journal,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/health/mdma-ptsd-retractions.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The journal Psychopharmacology has retracted three papers about MDMA-assisted therapy due to unethical conduct at one of the study sites. Several authors of the papers are affiliated with Lykos Therapeutics, whose application for MDMA-assisted therapy to treat PTSD was recently rejected by the FDA. The FDA cited concerns about missing data and issues with the study's design, requesting Lykos to conduct an additional clinical trial. Lykos plans to appeal the FDA's decision and disagrees with the journal's retraction, stating that the articles remain scientifically sound.

The retraction is linked to an incident involving an unlicensed Canadian therapist who engaged in a sexual relationship with a participant after the trial. The patient, Meaghan Buisson, alleged sexual assault, while the therapist claimed the relationship was consensual. This incident has raised concerns about the vulnerabilities of patients during psychedelic treatments, leading to stricter requirements for clinical trials. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which conducted the research, acknowledged the incident in 2019 and reported it to health authorities. Lykos admitted to not notifying the journal about the violations but argued that a correction would have been more appropriate than a retraction.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-12 16:21:44+0000

A new batch of inflation data and earnings from major retailers will again put the spotlight on consumer confidence and economic growth. After a topsy-turvy week, investors brace for more volatility. S&P 500 futures were up slightly after fears of a slowdown in growth and hiring rocked the benchmark index last week. Despite a stomach-churning rout on Monday and a bounce-back rally on Thursday, the S&P 500 ended the week down just 0.04 percent.

The big event this week is Wednesday’s inflation data, with economists forecasting a slight uptick in the Consumer Price Index. However, Wall Street doesn’t think that will dissuade the Fed from cutting interest rates at its next meeting in September. If the central bank doesn’t start lowering rates soon, it could dispirit the American consumer, warned Brian Moynihan, the C.E.O. of Bank of America.

Markets are still on edge, with the VIX spiking near levels last reached during the early days of the Covid pandemic and the 2008 global financial crisis.

The recently established U.S.-China Financial Working Group is set to meet for discussions about financial stability and curbing the flow of fentanyl. A group of senior Biden administration officials is traveling to Shanghai this week for high-level meetings intended to keep the economic relationship between the United States and China stable amid rising trade tensions. The talks will focus on maintaining economic and financial stability, capital markets, and efforts to curb fentanyl trafficking.

Despite improved communication over the past year, the economic relationship remains strained due to disagreements over industrial policy and China's dominance in green energy technology. The Biden administration imposed new tariffs in May on various Chinese imports and is restricting American investments in sectors deemed a national security threat. The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Department official Brent Neiman, will meet with senior Chinese officials, including the deputy governor of the People's Bank of China.

The discussions will also cover financial stability, cross-border data issues, and private-sector efforts to advance transition finance. American and Chinese financial regulators have been conducting exercises to coordinate responses to potential crises. The Biden administration has urged China to prevent the export of chemicals used to produce fentanyl, with recent signs of progress from China on this front.

This Theater Company in Wisconsin Banks on the Glory of the Human Voice,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/theater/american-players-theater-wisconsin.html,"This is an article by New York Times. For a regular theatergoer, a recent July evening in rural Wisconsin was peak surreal. It could have been the sight of an amphitheater packed to its 1,075-seat capacity for a weeknight performance of the fairly obscure French comedy “Ring Round the Moon.” Or maybe it was that the actors didn’t have mics, which is a rarity nowadays. From my seat, I could see audience members leaning in, transfixed by those unamplified voices.

“They’re here to listen,” Brenda DeVita, the artistic director of American Players Theater, said of the faithful who flock to Spring Green, about an hour west of Madison. A.P.T., in its 45th season, describes itself as a language-based company, which explains why it has doubled down on idiosyncratic choices in the current theatrical landscape. One is not doing musicals. Another is eschewing mics.

That last is partly a practical choice since A.P.T. productions — nine this season, with the last closing on Nov. 10 — are done in repertory. But banking on the glory of the human voice is primarily an artistic decision: Nothing comes between the actors, their words and the public.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-12 19:03:55+0000

Brands love when social media stars take to Instagram or TikTok to advertise their products, but many are eager to avoid influencers who discuss politics. This has become a challenging task in the unpredictable influencer industry, especially with the presidential election approaching. Marketing agencies are pitching new tools that assess the ""brand safety"" of social media personalities, using artificial intelligence to predict whether an influencer will engage in political discussions.

Captiv8, a marketing firm, has introduced a tool that analyzes mentions of influencers in online articles to determine their likelihood of discussing elections or political topics. This tool assigns letter grades to creators based on their content, with an ""A"" indicating very safe and a ""C"" suggesting caution. The grading system considers sensitive social issues, hate speech, and explicit content.

Viral Nation, another influencer agency, offers a product that creates ""risk profiles"" for creators by assessing years of posts and detecting visual elements like weapons or protest signs, even if not explicitly mentioned.

I.V.F. Threats in Alabama Drive Clinics to Ship Out Embryos,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/health/ivf-embryos-alabama.html,"This is an article by New York Times. An emerging movement against in vitro fertilization is driving some doctors and patients in red states to move or destroy frozen embryos. The embryo migration is most striking in Alabama, where the State Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos were “unborn children.” Since then, at least four of Alabama’s seven fertility clinics have hired biotech companies to move the cells elsewhere. A fifth clinic is working with a doctor in New York to discard embryos because of concerns about the legality of doing so in Alabama.

Fertility patients outside of Alabama are also worried about how their embryos might be affected by lawmakers who believe human life begins at conception. Since the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, 14 states have passed total or near-total abortion bans. The Southern Baptists, the country’s largest Protestant denomination, voted in June to oppose I.V.F., calling for the protection of “frozen embryonic human beings.”

In Texas, Diana Zucknick spent $1,550 to send a tank of liquid nitrogen holding five of her embryos to New York for safekeeping. In South Dakota, Jennifer Zabel destroyed two embryos due to fears that the state would take control of them. Meanwhile, Dr. Preston Parry in Mississippi noted that more of his fertility patients are choosing to make fewer embryos at a time, prolonging the typical I.V.F. process to minimize leftover embryos.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-12 09:00:59+0000
"Uber, Facing Sexual-Assault Litigation, Pushes Plan That May Curb Suits",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/business/uber-nevada-referendum.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Uber has spent millions trying to get a proposal on the Nevada ballot that would restrict the legal fees that bankroll many lawsuits against companies. The company is seeking to place a measure on Nevada’s ballot that would drastically limit the amount of money that lawyers could collect when they brought successful lawsuits. If the measure passes, it will make it less attractive — and in some cases financially impractical — for plaintiffs’ lawyers to file such suits.

The initiative is being spearheaded by Nevadans for Fair Recovery, a political action committee created this year by Uber and its lobbyists. The PAC has presented the measure as a way to protect people from trial lawyers who are “getting rich at the expense of plaintiffs and everyone else.” Uber has put $5 million into the PAC and is its only financial backer.

A correction was made on August 12, 2024, stating that the measure could go before Nevada voters in 2026, not as soon as next year.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-12 18:37:31+0000
Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games Planners See Economic Upside,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/business/economy/olympics-los-angeles-2028-economy.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The Summer Games will be the third for Los Angeles as host, but it will be a challenge to repeat the financial success of 1984. At a news conference last month outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Mayor Karen Bass announced that the city had secured nearly $80 million in federal funds to go toward zero-emission buses and charging infrastructure. As the city prepares to host the 2028 Games, construction crews have fanned out, racing to bolster the area’s infrastructure to accommodate hundreds of thousands of visitors.

Three main projects — expanding the rail system, revamping the airport, and renovating the downtown convention center — will have lasting effects on the region. The city sees the Olympics as a revenue producer, not an expense, and must disprove skeptics who say it could be a boondoggle. In 2019, then-mayor Eric Garcetti said he expected the city to turn a $1 billion profit.

For the current mayor, Karen Bass, hosting the Olympics is about connecting visitors with small businesses citywide. “What determines success is for everybody to benefit,” Ms. Bass said in an interview. “They need to know about Little Bangladesh and Little Ethiopia and Little Armenia.”",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-12 15:32:57+0000
Spain Is Thirsty. Here’s How It Gets Water.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/business/spain-water-desalination.html,"This is an article by New York Times. To supply water for a number of needs, from tourism to agriculture, Spain and other dry nations are increasingly relying on desalination plants that convert seawater into fresh water. On a fiery hot day in late June, tourists filled the cafes and hotel rooms along Spain’s Mediterranean coast, including in Torrevieja, a small city of tightly stacked apartment blocks running along a curved beach. The seasonal population surge in this dry region might strain water resources were it not for a set of buildings overlooking a pink-tinged lagoon nearby.

These low-slung structures house a vast network of pipes, pumps, and tanks in a plant that performs a kind of alchemy crucial to the economy of this part of Spain: drawing huge volumes of water from the sea, removing the salt, and creating more than 60 million gallons of fresh water a day. Acciona, a Spanish company that built the plant, says the facility can supply water for 1.6 million people. For much of the year, though, the output is largely used to nurture oranges, lemons, and other crops for consumers in Northern Europe.

But when the crowds of tourists arrive in the summer, more water is diverted into the city’s pipes for showering and other domestic use. The Torrevieja plant is the largest of its kind in Europe, and similar plants dot the Spanish coastline, enabling rampant coastal development in parched areas and supporting an agricultural industry that is considered among the world’s most proficient at managing water.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-12 04:01:16+0000
What ‘It Ends With Us’ Says About the Blake Lively Brand,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/movies/it-ends-with-us-blake-lively-brand.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Blake Lively’s hair is like a character unto itself in the new romantic drama “It Ends With Us.” Her thick mane shapeshifts with her role, Lily Bloom, a flower shop owner who falls in and out of love with an abusive neurosurgeon. Lively’s hair, dyed a soft ginger, is artfully messy when she gets her hands dirty starting up the store. The camera follows a mass of buoyant curls when she struts into a party dressed to impress the man who will ultimately betray her. 

In many ways, “It Ends With Us” is a brand-building exercise for Lively. The film, directed by Justin Baldoni, serves as an advertisement for the world of Lively — not just her talent but her celebrity and her other significant role, mogul. On the most readily understandable level, “It Ends With Us” makes a convincing case for Lively as an actress. Her particular je ne sais quoi was evident back in the 2007 pilot of “Gossip Girl,” where her character’s allure captivated everyone around her. 

While Lively made a bid for a film career, she seemed to struggle to find her niche in movies, with some performances receiving praise but nothing propelling her to the next level of fame on the big screen.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-11 19:08:55+0000
‘It Ends With Us’ Soars at the Box Office,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/it-ends-with-us-box-office.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The film, which cost $25 million to make, is on track to earn an estimated $50 million in North America on its opening weekend, analysts say. Colleen Hoover’s book “It Ends With Us” has been a fixture on the best-seller list for years, and now, the movie adaptation has become a smash at the box office. Starring Blake Lively, the romance is based on Ms. Hoover’s most popular book, which has sold 8 million copies and found fans worldwide.

The low-budget film comes at a time when there has been little in the marketplace geared to women. Sony took advantage of this dearth with a potent social media campaign featuring Ms. Lively and contributions from her friend Taylor Swift. On Friday alone, the PG-13 rated film earned more than $24 million, with projections suggesting it will earn about $12 million on Sunday.

The film’s performance is a welcome boost for the box office, which is still down some 16 percent since last year. Reviews have been middling, but audiences are giving it high marks, with a Rotten Tomatoes audience score hovering at 94 percent positive. The film will just miss the No. 1 slot for the weekend, with Mr. Reynolds’s hit, “Deadpool vs. Wolverine,” holding on for its third frame.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-11 18:37:54+0000
How Has Tech Changed Your School Experience? We Want to Hear About It.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/technology/phone-tech-use-schools.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Some states are banning phones in schools to reduce classroom distraction and cyberbullying. Digital devices and apps can be great tools in schools, but they can also be a classroom distraction or even a weapon. Some students spend so much class time on their smartphones, commenting on social media or texting their friends, that it hampers their learning. Additionally, some school children and teenagers have used their phones to bully or sexually exploit their classmates, or post videos of student fights on social media. Classroom devices like Chromebooks and iPads, while helpful, can also enable distractions and facilitate problems like bullying.

To better understand tech use and misuse in schools, I’d like to hear from teachers, students, parents, and school administrators about your experiences.

"Atop ABC, a Personal Connection to Kamala Harris",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/abc-debate-dana-walden-kamala-harris.html,"This is an article by New York Times. On paper, the potential for a conflict of interest seems obvious: ABC News, the host of next month’s high-stakes presidential debate, falls under the purview of a top corporate executive at Disney who happens to be longtime friends with the Democratic nominee. The executive, Dana Walden, first met Kamala Harris in 1994. Their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s. The Waldens — “extraordinary friends,” per the vice president — have donated money to Ms. Harris’s political campaigns since at least 2003, when she ran for district attorney in San Francisco.

“In many ways, Dana and Matt are responsible for my marriage,” Ms. Harris joked at a fund-raiser in April 2022 at the Waldens’ home in Brentwood, a wealthy Los Angeles enclave where Ms. Harris and Mr. Emhoff also own a residence. ABC News says that any perception of a conflict involving Ms. Walden is not reality. The company states that the executive, who oversees 18 businesses across the sprawling Disney empire, is only involved in the news division’s corporate matters and has no say in editorial decisions.

“ABC News has built its longstanding reputation on journalistic integrity,” the network said in a statement. “All editorial decisions are in the hands of ABC News management and the seasoned journalists and producers of ABC, who hold themselves to the highest journalistic standards.”",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-11 15:18:17+0000
Why Schools Are Racing to Ban Student Phones,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/technology/school-phone-bans-indiana-louisiana.html,"This is an article by New York Times. As the new school year starts, a wave of new laws that aim to curb distracted learning is taking effect in Indiana, Louisiana, and other states. Cellphones have become a school scourge, with more than 70 percent of high school teachers stating that student phone distraction is a “major problem,” according to a recent Pew Research survey. This has led to a bipartisan effort among states to crack down on rampant student cellphone use, with at least eight states passing laws or adopting rules to limit phone use during school hours.

The issue extends beyond mere distraction; students have used their phones to bully, sexually exploit, and share videos of physical attacks on peers. However, enforcing cellphone restrictions can be challenging for teachers without schoolwide rules mandating that students place their phones in lockers or designated areas. In response, state lawmakers and some governors are advocating for more uniform restrictions in public schools.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-11 09:00:49+0000
Can Free Rent Revive Downtown San Francisco?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/san-francisco-storefronts-free-rent.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The city, which is among those most devastated in the country after the pandemic, is trying to lure businesses back with a free-rent period. There’s a buzz of energy in downtown San Francisco from a source that has been missing for years: occupied storefronts. One of those shops is Paper Son Coffee, a roaster with flavors popular among Latin and Asian American communities that has been operating in the South of Market neighborhood since June. Before that, the space had been empty for nearly three years.

“People who work or live in the neighborhood stop in and are like, ‘Wow, there is something here!’” said Alexander Pong, an owner of Paper Son. Paper Son is part of an initiative to help San Francisco return to the days before it became a devastating example of what could go wrong with U.S. cities during the pandemic. The company was chosen to participate in Vacant to Vibrant, a program initiated last year by the city’s mayor, London Breed, to fill empty space downtown. Downtown San Francisco has the highest concentration of vacant storefronts in the city.

Under the program, city and business leaders provide free rent for up to six months, as well as other funding for business expenses and incentives like technical and business permit assistance, to entrepreneurs who want to set up shop in empty spaces.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-11 09:00:37+0000

As the founder, public face and heat-seeking curator of The Free Press, a new media company with ambitions to overtake the old media, Ms. Weiss, 40, has identified a mélange of reliable foils: the illiberal left; diversity, equity and inclusion programs; opponents of Israel; The New York Times, where Ms. Weiss worked until 2020.

For her sins against groupthink, Ms. Weiss has suggested, she faced eviction from the media “cool kids’ table,” without regret. “I don’t need to be with the beautiful people,” she said at a conference in San Diego recently. In fact, luminaries from both camps appear to enjoy her company.

With her news and opinion site, a popular podcast (“Honestly with Bari Weiss”) and a lucrative turn on the speechmaking circuit, Ms. Weiss has amassed high status in what might be considered the no-tribes tribe of American power.

Disney has announced significant expansion plans for its theme parks and cruise ships, aiming to invest billions to enhance visitor experiences amid softening demand. The company will increase its cruise ship fleet from nine to 13 by 2031, adding four new ships to the four already planned. The Magic Kingdom in Florida will see its largest expansion in 53 years, introducing new areas themed around Disney villains and Pixar's ""Cars."" Disneyland Resort in California will feature two superhero-themed rides, a water-based ""Avatar"" attraction, a ""Coco"" ride, and a show with an animatronic Walt Disney.

Additionally, Disney is developing a ""Monsters, Inc."" roller coaster, an ""Encanto"" experience, a ""Lion King"" water ride, and a major ""Spider-Man"" roller coaster. The expansion also includes new nighttime parades and elaborate outdoor pageants.

What Caused a Plane to Fall From the Sky in Brazil?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/world/americas/brazil-plane-crash-investigation.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Officials are investigating potential causes of a plane crash that killed 62 people near São Paulo. Brazilian forensic workers examined the wreckage of VoePass Flight 2283 in a residential area of Vinhedo, Brazil, on Saturday. The plane crashed on Friday, prompting an analysis of the black boxes to understand why it fell from 17,000 feet. Aviation experts believe the plane had stalled, meaning its wings lost the lift needed to keep it aloft. 

John Cox, an airline pilot and crash investigation consultant, stated, “You can’t get into a spin without stalling.” However, the reasons behind the stall remain unclear. Investigators are considering various factors, including loss of speed, excessive nose pitch, ice buildup on wings, engine failure, and the pilots' state of mind. Thomas Anthony, director of the aviation safety program at the University of Southern California, emphasized that it’s typically not just one factor that leads to such incidents.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-11 13:26:40+0000
The Social Media Olympics,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/dealbook/the-social-media-olympics.html,"This is an article by New York Times. More lenient posting rules for Olympic athletes have helped spark a deluge of successful social media content, changing how we watch the Games. Just moments after winning a gold medal, American wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt shared her excitement on social media, highlighting a new trend in athlete engagement. This shift is seen as a way to recapture the shared national experience that characterized past Olympics.

For years, the Olympics struggled to maintain relevance due to a fragmented media landscape and various challenges, including pandemic restrictions and geopolitical tensions. A significant factor was the limited presence of the Olympics on social media, as strict rules around the use of the Olympic rings restricted content sharing. However, new, more lenient social media rules for athletes and a rethinking among broadcasters have transformed this dynamic.

Athletes can now cultivate their own personalities akin to social media influencers, which has resonated with audiences.

How to Avoid Online Scams and What to Do if You Become a Victim,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-scams-advice.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Cybercrime is on the rise, but even the best antivirus software can’t thwart scammers who target the human psyche. Some of the most damaging and costly scams involve what’s known as “social engineering.” That’s when fraudsters use time-tested techniques of deception and emotional manipulation, tricking people into divulging personal or financial information, or even granting remote access to their computers.

People of all ages and socioeconomic levels are potential targets, but older Americans are particularly vulnerable. They’re more likely to have amassed savings, and they’re perceived to be more isolated or perhaps less computer savvy. There are also more entry points for scammers now — in our text messages, social media, dating sites or online groups. 

“What is changing is the criminals’ ability to connect with us and that’s because of the device we carry with us 24/7,” said Amy Nofziger, director of fraud victim support at AARP Fraud Watch Network. “A day doesn’t go by where we don’t have a million-dollar loss.”",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-10 09:03:04+0000
How to Keep Your Money Safe if Your Online Lender Is Not a Bank,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/online-lending-banking-money-risks.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The collapse of a little-known intermediary named Synapse Financial Technologies has put a spotlight on the risk that customers face when using popular banking start-ups. If it looks like a bank, advertises like a bank, and accepts money like a bank — it still might not be a bank. This lesson is being learned by tens of thousands of depositors who entrusted their savings to online-only lenders like Juno, Yieldstreet, and Yotta, which advertise high interest rates and FDIC protection. However, these companies merely collect money and funnel it through intermediaries to banks.

The recent collapse of Synapse has highlighted the risks associated with these new lenders, as the F.D.I.C. insurance did not automatically apply, resulting in nearly $100 million of deposits being frozen or lost. After The New York Times reported on the issue, readers sought guidance on how to determine whether their money was safe.

Susan Wojcicki, who helped turn Google from a start-up in her garage into an internet juggernaut, and who became one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent female executives with her leadership of YouTube, died on Friday. She was 56. Her death was confirmed by her husband, Dennis Troper, who wrote on Facebook that she had been living with lung cancer for two years. Ms. Wojcicki’s more than two decades with Google began in 1998 in her house in Menlo Park, Calif., part of which she rented to her friends Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the company’s founders. 

Ms. Wojcicki, who had been working at Intel, soon joined Google as one of its earliest employees and was its first marketing manager. Over the years, she reached its executive ranks, becoming Google’s most senior woman employee. She eventually led YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006, and which became one of the world’s largest social media companies. “She is as core to the history of Google as anyone, and it’s hard to imagine the world without her,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said in a statement.

Not long ago, Bangladesh was hailed as an economic miracle. Its singular focus on exporting textiles and apparel delivered rapid growth, lifting millions out of poverty and winning the country’s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, fame and admiration. However, Ms. Hasina’s abrupt exit from power this week has exposed the limitations of that strategy, as Bangladesh struggles to combat steep inflation and joblessness that economists say are largely the result of poor policy decisions. Her increasingly authoritarian rule and Bangladesh’s widespread corruption only added to the frustration that boiled over and forced her ouster.

Now, Bangladesh must decide its future. Student protesters who had called for Ms. Hasina’s resignation have brought in Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate and microfinance pioneer, to oversee an interim government. Mr. Yunus faces a daunting task. Most immediately, the country must restore order and stabilize its economy. In the longer term, Bangladesh will have to confront the wider economic stresses that had sent the protesters into the streets in the first place. All of that must happen on top of urgent demands to address the widespread abuses of Ms. Hasina’s repressive tenure.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-12 01:39:56+0000

Like many cities around Britain shaken by anti-immigrant riots over the past week, Hartlepool, a seaside town on the northeast coast, has partly recovered from the devastating waves of unrest. The unrest reflects deeper economic grievances that have been exploited by various groups.

The Food and Drug Administration on Friday declined to approve MDMA-assisted therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, dealing a serious blow to the nascent field of psychedelic medicine and dashing the hopes of many Americans who are desperate for new treatments. The F.D.A. said there was insufficient data to allow its use, and it asked the company seeking approval for the treatment, Lykos Therapeutics, to conduct an additional clinical trial to assess whether the drug, commonly known as Ecstasy or molly, would be safe and effective.

An additional clinical trial could add years, and millions of dollars, to the approval process. If approved, MDMA would have become the first psychedelic compound to be regulated by federal health authorities. Supporters of psychedelic medicine were deeply disappointed, and some said they were stunned, having assumed the therapy’s promising data would overcome flaws in the company’s clinical trials, which had been designed in consultation with F.D.A. scientists.

“This is an earthquake for those in the field who thought F.D.A. approval would be a cinch,” said Michael Pollan, the best-selling author and co-founder of the UC Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics. But the agency’s decision had not been entirely unexpected, after a group of independent experts convened by the F.D.A. to evaluate Lykos’s data met in June and did not recommend the treatment. On two central questions, the experts voted overwhelmingly that the company had not proven the treatment was effective, and that the drug therapy’s benefits did not outweigh the risks.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-10 11:56:53+0000

Stellantis announced plans on Friday to lay off as many as 2,450 workers later this year at a pickup truck plant near Detroit, the latest sign of trouble for the trans-Atlantic automaker. The layoffs are expected to begin as early as Oct. 8 at the Ram truck plant in Warren, Mich., where production will be reduced to one shift from two. Stellantis’s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has stated that the company needs to cut costs, noting that at least one North American factory was operating at an unsatisfactory level.

The company has been affected by sluggish sales in North America, where it generates most of its profits, along with bloated costs and manufacturing inefficiencies. It reported last month that profits in the first six months of 2024 fell by nearly half to 5.6 billion euros (about $6 billion). Tavares described the first-half 2024 results as ""disappointing and humbling,"" emphasizing the need to address operational issues.

The layoffs are related to a planned transition to a new version of the Ram pickup that is just going into production at a plant in Sterling Heights, Mich. The Warren plant will continue making an older version of the truck on one shift, and the actual number of workers affected will likely be lower than the 2,450 noted in a report to the state of Michigan.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-09 21:57:20+0000

The Justice Department charged three current and former executives at Smartmatic, the voting technology company, with participating in a bribery scheme in the Philippines. The indictment revealed that from 2015 to 2018, Smartmatic’s president and co-founder, Roger Piñate, along with other executives, funneled at least $1 million in bribes to Juan Andres Bautista, the former chairman of the Philippine elections commission, to secure a contract for providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 elections. 

A Smartmatic spokesman stated that two of the charged individuals remain with the company and have been placed on leave, emphasizing their innocence until proven guilty. He also noted that no voter fraud has been alleged against Smartmatic itself. The bribes were reportedly funded through a slush fund created by overcharging for voting machines and laundered through various bank accounts globally. 

Piñate and another executive, Jorge Vasquez, face charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, while all four individuals involved are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering.

The Big Number: $8.4 Billion,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/business/the-big-number-8-4-billion-disney-earnings.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Disney reported revenue of $8.4 billion for its theme park unit for the three months that ended in June. While that was a 2 percent increase from the previous year, it was lower than expected, indicating that stubborn inflation and high interest rates were affecting Americans' ability to visit parks like Disney World and sail on Disney cruise ships. In its earnings report, Disney attributed the results to a “moderation of consumer demand.”

Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has referred to the theme parks as “a key growth engine.” Over the past decade, the company has relied on the parks to offset losses in other divisions, particularly as it has invested heavily in streaming services while facing declining revenue in its cable television business. Although Disney’s streaming service turned a profit in the quarter for the first time, the company’s stock has fallen around 29 percent since April 1.

Hugh F. Johnston, Disney’s chief financial officer, noted that the lower-income consumer is feeling stress, while higher-income consumers are traveling internationally more. This weak growth raises broader concerns about the U.S. economy potentially dipping into a recession, as Americans have seen their pandemic-era savings diminish, leaving them with less disposable income.

Voters in Arizona will decide in November whether to establish a right to abortion in the state constitution, a move that could significantly impact the political landscape and provide an edge to Democrats. This decision comes amid a broader national conversation about abortion access following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. 

In international news, Hamas has announced it will not attend upcoming peace talks, complicating efforts to stabilize the region. The absence of Hamas from these discussions raises concerns about the potential for renewed violence and the challenges facing diplomats trying to broker a ceasefire.

Kamala Harris Set to Lay Out Economic Agenda in North Carolina Speech,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/kamala-harris-economy-north-carolina.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Vice President Kamala Harris’s sudden ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has generated a host of questions about her economic agenda, including how much she will stick to the details of President Biden’s positions, tweak them, or chart entirely new ones. When she begins to roll out her policy vision this week, Ms. Harris is likely to answer only some of those questions. During an economy-focused speech on Friday in Raleigh, N.C., Ms. Harris will outline a sort of reboot of the administration’s economic agenda, according to four people familiar with Ms. Harris’s plans. She will lay out an approach relatively light on details, shifting emphasis from Mr. Biden’s focus on job creation and made-in-America manufacturing toward efforts to rein in the cost of living. However, it will rarely break from Mr. Biden on substance. This strategy reflects the advice economic aides have given Ms. Harris: to be clear and bold in talking about the economy, but not overly specific. Her ability to do that has been effectively enabled by the unusual circumstances of Mr. Biden’s abrupt departure from the presidential race, which allowed Ms. Harris to secure the Democratic nomination without enduring a long primary campaign.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 12:14:46+0000
"Gwen Walz, Tim Walz’s Wife, Redefined the Role of a Political Spouse in Minnesota",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/style/gwen-walz-tim-walz-minnesota.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Gwen Walz, the wife of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, has redefined the role of a political spouse. Early in her husband's political career, she stepped in to help during a critical moment. In 2006, when Tim was scheduled to speak at a fundraising dinner but had laryngitis, Gwen took the stage instead. Her confidence and clarity impressed the audience, leading some to wonder why she wasn't running for office herself.

As Tim Walz gains national attention, particularly after being announced as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate, Gwen is also stepping into the spotlight. Critics have attempted to label her as a left-wing radical, but those who know her in Minnesota describe her as a coolheaded and competent partner to her charismatic husband. Gwen's background as a public-school teacher has equipped her with the skills to engage effectively with the public. As she enters this new phase, her role as a political spouse continues to evolve, showcasing her strengths alongside her husband's political journey.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:02:40+0000
Walz Faces New Scrutiny Over 2020 Riots: Was He Too Slow to Send Troops?,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/tim-walz-george-floyd-riots-minneapolis.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Gov. Tim Walz’s response to the unrest following George Floyd's murder has come under renewed scrutiny, particularly after he was selected as Kamala Harris’s running mate. Just two days after Floyd's death, the mayor of Minneapolis reached out to Walz for assistance as the police struggled to control escalating riots. On May 27, 2020, the city's police chief also requested immediate help from the National Guard, specifying the need for 600 troops. However, it wasn't until the following afternoon that Walz signed an executive order to activate the Guard. By that time, rioters had already set a police station on fire, and it took until Saturday for the situation to begin to stabilize. 

Walz, a National Guard veteran, faced criticism for his delayed response during a time when Minnesota was at the center of a national conversation about racism and police violence. The events of those days have continued to haunt his administration, especially as he navigates his new role in the national spotlight. The scrutiny over his actions during the riots reflects broader concerns about leadership in times of crisis.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:02:26+0000

Ever since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential campaign three weeks ago, polls and campaign finance data have shown how the race has changed. She has come from behind to build a small lead over former President Donald J. Trump in national polls and in several swing states, and she raised far more money than he did last month.

U.S. Considers Breaking Up Google to Address Search Monopoly,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-monopoly-antitrust-justice-department.html,"This is an article by New York Times. The Justice Department and state attorneys general are discussing various scenarios to remedy Google’s dominance in online search, including a breakup of the company. Google was found last week to have violated antitrust law by illegally maintaining a monopoly in internet search. Now discussions over how to fix those violations have begun.

Justice Department officials are considering what remedies to ask a federal judge to order against the search giant. They are discussing various proposals, including breaking off parts of Google, such as its Chrome browser or Android smartphone operating system. Other scenarios under consideration include forcing Google to make its data available to rivals or mandating that it abandon deals that made its search engine the default option on devices like the iPhone.

The deliberations are in their early stages. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has asked the Justice Department and Google to come up with a process for determining a fix by Sept. 4. Last week’s ruling that Google was a monopolist was a landmark antitrust decision, raising serious questions about the power of tech giants in the modern internet era.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 14:41:16+0000
Google’s Stock Falls on Break-up Reports,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/dealbook/google-stock-antitrust-break-up.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, were down more than 2.5 percent in early trading on Wednesday morning on news that the Justice Department is considering breaking up the technology giant for maintaining an illegal search monopoly. That would be a devastating blow for the company, but it could also have huge ramifications for the broader tech sector, with Apple, Amazon, and Meta all facing their own antitrust battles with the government.

In a ruling last week, Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia agreed with the government and multiple states that Google’s dominance in search was constraining competition. Google said it would appeal. Mehta has asked both parties to submit suggested remedies by Sept. 4, with a hearing set to take place two days later.

Dismantling Google is one potential remedy the government is discussing. That could involve forcing the company to break off Chrome, its web browser, or its Android smartphone operating system as a penalty for maintaining an illegal monopoly in search, a business that has generated enormous profits for years. It would be the most significant antitrust ruling against a tech company since a drawn-out effort more than two decades ago that targeted Microsoft.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 14:04:09+0000
How One Tech Monopoly Paved the Way for Another,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/podcasts/the-daily/microsoft-google-antitrust.html,"This is an article by New York Times. In a landmark antitrust ruling against Google last week, another case from the 1990s was at the heart of the story. Steve Lohr, who covers technology and the economy for The Times, explains the influence of United States v. Microsoft and what lessons that case might hold for the future of Big Tech today. The ruling on Google’s search dominance marks the first antitrust decision of the modern internet era against a technology giant. Economists, legal scholars, and business historians continue to debate the impact that the Microsoft antitrust case had, or didn’t have, on the tech landscape. 

The recent ruling is likely to have major ripple effects, nearly a quarter-century after Microsoft lost a similar case. The implications of this ruling could reshape the competitive landscape of the tech industry, echoing the lessons learned from the Microsoft case. As the tech sector evolves, the scrutiny of monopolistic practices remains a critical issue. The ongoing discussions surrounding these antitrust cases highlight the challenges of regulating powerful tech companies. Ultimately, the outcomes of these cases will influence how technology giants operate in the future.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 10:00:39+0000
How the World’s Oldest Humpback Whale Has Survived Is a Mystery,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/science/oldest-humpack-whale-old-timer.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Old Timer, a male humpback whale first photographed in 1972, was spotted last month near Alaska, enduring in the Pacific Ocean while some other humpbacks have struggled in a changing environment. The tail of Old Timer, which is mostly black with white speckles, is unique, much like a fingerprint. Adam A. Pack, a marine mammal researcher, recognized the flukes of Old Timer during his research in Frederick Sound, Alaska. At over 53 years old, Old Timer is considered the oldest known humpback whale in the world.

Humpback whale populations have rebounded in recent decades after being severely depleted by commercial whaling, but they still face threats from ship strikes, entanglements in fishing gear, and climate change. Dr. Pack had previously worried about Old Timer's survival, especially after the last sighting in 2015 during a record-breaking heat wave that caused the deaths of many marine animals. However, seeing Old Timer again was heartwarming for Dr. Pack, as it demonstrated that some whales are resilient.

Future studies of Old Timer and other humpbacks will be enhanced by artificial intelligence, which Dr. Pack hopes will provide insights into how and why some whales can withstand tough conditions.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:02:33+0000

Moscow has begun withdrawing some troops from Ukraine in an effort to repel Kyiv’s offensive into western Russia, according to United States and Ukrainian officials, but it remains unclear what impact this might have on the overall battlefield. Dmytro Lykhovii, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Army, stated that Russia had moved some units from the southern Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro to other areas of fighting, including the Kursk region of western Russia, where the incursion has taken place.

A U.S. official confirmed that Russia had pulled out small numbers of troops from Ukraine, though specifics on their location or the number of soldiers involved were not provided. Analysts suggest that one of the goals of the Ukrainian offensive is to draw Russian forces away from the front lines in Ukraine to relieve Ukrainian troops struggling against relentless Russian attacks. However, it is too early to determine whether the latest Russian troop movements will achieve that goal.

There is little indication that Moscow has redeployed troops from eastern Ukraine, where Russia has been steadily advancing. Instead, the Russian Army appears to have sent in reinforcements drawn mainly from less combat-ready units based in northern Russia and Ukraine, according to military experts.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 13:59:13+0000
Germany Issues Arrest Warrant for Ukrainian Over Nord Stream Explosion,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/europe/nord-stream-explosion-germany-ukraine-arrest-warrant.html,"This is an article by New York Times. A European arrest warrant was issued for a Ukrainian man suspected of involvement in blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline nearly two years ago, Polish prosecutors said on Wednesday. The sabotage in September 2022 of the Nord Stream pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe has become one of the central mysteries of the war in Ukraine, prompting extensive finger-pointing and guesswork. The Polish prosecutors office stated it had received the warrant, issued by Germany, in June for a suspect living in Poland at the time. The suspect, identified only as Volodymyr Z., left the country before Polish authorities could detain him. 

The German federal prosecutor’s office declined to comment on the warrant, whose existence was first reported by a trio of German news outlets. This warrant marks the first significant development toward potentially solving who was behind an act of sabotage that has sown political distrust among Western allies and raised the geopolitical stakes in Europe’s Baltic region. The sabotage was first detected on September 26 when a vast swirl of bubbles appeared on the surface of the Baltic Sea in international waters between Denmark and Sweden.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 13:36:46+0000
Hunter Biden Sought State Department Help for Burisma,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/us/politics/hunter-biden-ukrainian-company.html,"This is an article by New York Times. After President Biden dropped his re-election bid, his administration released records showing that while he was vice president, his son solicited U.S. government assistance. Hunter Biden sought assistance from the U.S. government for a potentially lucrative energy project in Italy while his father was vice president, according to newly released records and interviews. The records indicate that Hunter Biden wrote at least one letter to the U.S. ambassador to Italy in 2016 seeking assistance for the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, where he was a board member.

Embassy officials appear to have been uneasy with the request from the son of the sitting vice president on behalf of a foreign company. A Commerce Department official based in the U.S. Embassy in Rome expressed caution, stating, “I want to be careful about promising too much.” The official noted that the U.S. government should not be actively advocating with the government of Italy without the company going through the Department of Commerce Advocacy Center.

Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Biden, stated that his client “asked various people,” including the U.S. ambassador to Italy at the time, whether they could arrange an introduction between Burisma and the president of the Tuscany region of Italy, where Burisma was pursuing a geothermal project.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 00:27:13+0000
Kamala Harris Could Be America’s Health Care President,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/opinion/kamala-harris-health-care.html,"This is an article by New York Times. From the moment Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Republicans have sought to paint her as a far-left California liberal. However, Ms. Harris didn’t seek to eliminate private insurance in 2019; her core health plan was an intelligently designed “public option.” This plan aimed to encourage Americans to buy into a revamped Medicare program, offering the choice of public or private coverage. As the so-called father of the public option, I believe her 2019 proposal remains the strongest ever put forth by a presidential candidate, and she should embrace it as a central part of her 2024 campaign.

Health care is “unbelievably complex,” as former President Donald Trump remarked in 2017, and Americans are frustrated with high prices and insecure coverage. The G.O.P.’s failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act showed that a majority of Americans do not want to return to pre-A.C.A. conditions. This issue has unified the Democratic Party, intertwining with topics like abortion, maternal health, and the economic security of working families. However, there is still disagreement within the party on the primary health care policy goal, with progressives advocating for universal Medicare and moderates calling for an upgraded A.C.A. with a public option.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 14:36:41+0000
Catholic Converts Like JD Vance Are Reshaping Republican Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/opinion/jd-vance-catholic-convert-republican.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Despite institutional decline and internal conflict, Catholicism retains a surprising resonance in American life — especially in certain elite circles. It has emerged as the largest and perhaps the most vibrant religious group at many top universities and claims six of the nine Supreme Court justices as adherents. The Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism after attending Yale Law School, exemplifies this phenomenon. When he was baptized into the church in 2019, he joined an influential group of conservative converts who share a combination of social conservatism and a willingness to question many of the free-market orthodoxies of the pre-Trump Republican Party.

This group’s economic thinking distinguishes its members from an earlier cohort of conservative Catholic intellectuals who laid a stress on free markets. For Vance and others, Catholicism seems to be a resource for pushing back against the excesses of cultural and economic liberalism. Many of today’s converts look to resist the left-right fusion of libertarian cultural attitudes and free-market economics that has reshaped Western society over the past few decades. Rather than precipitating a radical overhaul of society, they have exerted a subtler influence that is nonetheless significant: altering how the Republican Party approaches policy and helping build a new consensus across party lines.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:02:13+0000
New York’s Promising Experiment in Making the Subways Safer ,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/opinion/nyc-subway-safety-criminal-justice.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Ameed Ademolu, a close-cropped and bespectacled nurse, descends the street-level stairs to the subway, clad in an orange and yellow vest and carrying a clipboard, paper and pencil. He halts, reaches into a pocket to unfold a K-95 mask and fits it over his mouth and nose. “The mask is for me,” he says, because “I’ve had people spit in my face.”

At the Fulton Street station in Downtown Manhattan, Mr. Ademolu encounters two men, one in his 20s and one older, the latter dependent on a cart piled with his belongings as a walker. The younger one is coherent but agitated, ripping up newspaper and scattering the pieces as he puffs on his vape. Both are homeless and have become friends after months on the subways.

Mr. Ademolu talks to them for half an hour. The older man declines Mr. Ademolu’s offer to have a shelter van pick him up, saying he knows that the shelter system cannot easily accommodate someone who cannot walk up and down stairs. The younger man decides he will go to a shelter. Mr. Ademolu takes the man upstairs to await the van.

Mr. Ademolu spends his days like this, pacing Manhattan subway platforms and stations, searching for people who appear severely mentally ill. He is a member of a Subway Co-Response Outreach, or SCOUT, team, a new project between the city and the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Why Democrats Should Sing the Union’s Civil War Anthems,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/13/opinion/thepoint/democrats-civil-war-anthems,"This is an article by New York Times. The Kamala Harris campaign has adopted a song by Beyoncé as its main musical anthem, but it could also embrace patriotic songs from the Civil War era to unite progressives. The right has distanced itself from traditional American symbols, creating an opportunity for liberals to reclaim the country’s iconography. Celebrating the Union's victory over the Confederacy through music could foster a sense of unity. Songs like “The Battle Cry of Freedom” and “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” resonate with themes of peace and equality, reflecting a willingness to fight for justice.

At a recent rally, the folk band Bon Iver performed “The Battle Cry of Freedom,” presenting a patriotic vision of American liberalism. Music has the power to convey ideological messages and connect with audiences across generations. The Harris campaign has a unique opportunity to use America’s musical heritage to build a modern political movement. By embracing this auditory history, they can create a compelling narrative that resonates with a diverse electorate.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:03:45+0000
The Global Race to Control A.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/briefing/ai-china-us-technology.html,"This is an article by New York Times. As artificial intelligence advances, many nations are worried about being left behind. The urgency is understandable. A.I. is improving quickly and could soon reshape the global economy, automate jobs, turbocharge scientific research, and even change how wars are waged. World leaders want companies in their country to control A.I. — and they want to benefit from its power. They fear that if they do not build powerful A.I. at home, they will be left dependent on a foreign country’s creations.

So A.I. nationalism — the idea that a country must develop its own tech to serve its own interests — is spreading. Countries have enacted new laws and regulations and formed new alliances. The United States, perhaps the best positioned in the global A.I. race, is using trade policy to cut off China from key microchips. In France, the president has praised a startup focused on chatbots and other tools that excel in French and other non-English languages. Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is investing billions into A.I. development and striking deals with major tech companies to establish his country as a new hub for A.I.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 10:19:50+0000

Stephen Colbert called it “a big night for weird old rich guys with no friends.” He remarked that Donald Trump’s return to X on Monday “just reminds people of the awful reason he was banned to begin with.” The broadcast was delayed 40 minutes after its scheduled start, which Musk blamed on a cyberattack, later implying it was done to silence Trump. 

Colbert humorously imitated Trump, saying, “Hey, there. Lying is my thing, buddy,” and added a jab at Musk about self-driving cars. Jimmy Fallon quipped, “It’s nice to know the guy who builds self-driving cars and spaceships hasn’t quite figured out how to broadcast a phone call.” Seth Meyers pointed out that Trump made at least 20 false claims during his interview, starting with, “It’s great to be here.” 

Meyers also commented on Trump’s voice, likening it to “a sugared-up kid on Halloween who won’t take out his plastic vampire teeth.” Desi Lydic noted the slurred speech during the interview, while Fallon suggested, “Can we get the guy some Fixodent?”",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 05:51:54+0000

Justice Juan M. Merchan, who oversaw the trial that led to Donald J. Trump’s conviction, declined for a third time to step aside from the case, dismissing claims from defense lawyers that he had a conflict of interest. In a three-page decision, the judge criticized Trump’s filing seeking his recusal as “rife with inaccuracies” and repetitive, asserting that there was no conflict of interest. Trump’s lawyers had argued that the judge’s daughter had a relationship with Vice President Kamala Harris, a claim disputed by her colleagues, and cited her work as a Democratic consultant. Prosecutors called the recusal request “a vexatious and frivolous attempt to relitigate” an issue already dismissed by the judge.

Justice Merchan, a moderate Democrat, had previously rejected Trump’s recusal requests last year and again in April. He cited a state advisory committee on judicial ethics, which found that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter’s interests. Trump renewed the recusal request after President Biden abandoned his campaign, as Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Justice Merchan expressed frustration with the defense’s repetitive filings, stating, “innuendo and mischaracterizations do not a conflict create.” He concluded that recusal was not necessary.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 13:41:09+0000

Mars, the company behind M&M’s and Snickers, has agreed to acquire Kellanova, the snack food business spun off by Kellogg’s last year, in a multibillion-dollar deal that will create a new global food giant. The acquisition, one of the largest food deals in years, values Kellanova at $35.9 billion, including debt, a hefty premium to the company’s market value before news of the deal first began to leak. Kellanova owns a large menu of brands including Cheez-It, Pringles, and Eggo.

Mars, which is privately owned and best known for its chocolate candies, has tried to broaden beyond sweets. In 2020, it bought Kind North America, the company that makes Kind Bars. Acquiring Kellanova would allow Mars to offer an array of both salty and sweet food, echoing a strategy that Hershey employed with its acquisition of the parent company of SkinnyPop and Dot’s Pretzels.

The deal comes at a tenuous time for food and beverage manufacturers. For more than two years, Big Food has steadily increased prices on products, partly to cover higher commodity and labor costs but also to expand their profit margins. Now, some consumers are pushing back, either buying less or trading down to generic brands, resulting in slower revenue growth and fewer items sold.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 11:56:41+0000

When Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan stepped down on Wednesday, he became the latest in a growing line of unpopular leaders to cycle through a sclerotic political system that has faced growing frustration from the public. Mr. Kishida, 67, announced at a news conference that he would not run in the governing Liberal Democratic Party’s leadership contest in September, the winner of which will go on to become the prime minister.

The Liberal Democrats have held an iron grip on Parliament for all but four years since 1955. But decades of scandals and its inability to tackle many of Japan’s deep-rooted challenges have spurred widespread voter dissatisfaction. Mr. Kishida, a moderate party stalwart, was not popular even when he first took office in October 2021, and in recent months his approval ratings have plummeted to new lows.

But for all that, even though polls have revealed the Japanese public’s deep discontent with the governing party, it only rarely appears at the ballot box. Low voter turnout and weak political opposition in Japan have left the Liberal Democratic Party largely insulated from the pressure of potentially losing a general election. Mr. Kishida said on Wednesday that he hoped his decision would enable the Liberal Democrats to make a big change.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 09:28:02+0000
Thai Premier Srettha Removed From Office on Ethics Charges,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/world/asia/thailand-prime-minister-srettha.html,"This is an article by New York Times. Thailand’s Constitutional Court ousted Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office on Wednesday, throwing the country into fresh political turmoil just days after the court dissolved the country’s main opposition party. In a 5-4 verdict, the court ruled that Mr. Srettha violated ethics standards after he appointed to his cabinet a member previously convicted of attempted bribery. 

Mr. Srettha was seen as a figurehead, closely allied with Thaksin Shinawatra, a populist former prime minister who has long sought to influence the country’s politics even after he was ousted and exiled in a 2006 coup. The court’s decision is likely to intensify the disillusionment of many Thais, who see the case as the latest proof of intervention by an unelected establishment that is quashing the people’s will. 

Last week, the same court ordered the disbandment of the Move Forward Party, a progressive party that won last year’s election but was blocked from forming a government. The constant upheaval in politics has diminished the government’s ability to address pressing issues such as reviving the country’s ailing, tourism-dependent economy. 

However, this dismissal is unlikely to galvanize angry protests. Mr. Srettha, a mild-mannered 62-year-old billionaire tycoon, was not a popular leader and was installed only because a military-backed Senate prevented Move Forward’s former leader from becoming premier. During his short term in office, Mr. Srettha was criticized for traveling abroad frequently with few results to show for it.",Global News,New York Times,2024-08-14 13:49:00+0000

At Copenhagen Fashion Week, outfits on and off the runway had a lively spirit that reflected the event’s location in a country known for its quality of life. Not every fashion week can be characterized as friendly, approachable, and relaxed, but those are three ways to describe this event. Although it has continued to grow since its inception almost 20 years ago, it doesn’t draw the same crowds as fashion weeks in New York, London, Milan, and Paris. This has allowed Copenhagen Fashion Week to avoid some of the egos and excess that can accompany its more established counterparts, aided by sustainability requirements for participating brands.

The latest installment showcased an inviting atmosphere, with diverse crowds and collections. Brands like Remain experimented with mesh fabrics and sleek silhouettes, while Henrik Vibskov embraced frenetic patterns in vivid prints.

At least 95 people were injured and a child was killed as a result of celebratory aerial firing in Karachi on the eve of Independence Day, a hospital official said on Wednesday. Incidents of aerial firing are a routine occurrence on occasions such as Independence Day and New Year’s Eve despite bans imposed in the past. According to a statement issued by police surgeon Dr. Summaiya Syed, a total of 95 aerial firing cases were reported across three major hospitals in Karachi. 

Thirty-nine cases were noted at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), while Abbasi Shaheed Hospital received 34 injured people. At the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto (SMBB) Trauma Centre, 22 injured were reported. The condition of one injured being treated at the SMBB Trauma Centre was “serious,” and a child had died, with a suspect in that case arrested. Police across Karachi’s Central District arrested 14 suspects, while the Korangi District police took five men into custody for the aerial firing incidents. The arrests were made in various areas, and weapons were allegedly recovered in all cases.",Pakistan,Dawn,2024-08-14 16:18:48+0500
"Ukraine is advancing deeper into Russia, Zelenskiy says",https://www.dawn.com/news/1852254/ukraine-is-advancing-deeper-into-russia-zelenskiy-says,"This is an article by Dawn. Ukraine said on Wednesday its forces had advanced further into Russia’s Kursk region in the biggest foreign incursion into Russia since World War Two, posing a dilemma for President Vladimir Putin according to US President Joe Biden. Thousands of Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of August 6 into Russia’s western Kursk region in what Putin called a major provocation aimed at gaining a stronger hand in possible future ceasefire talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy stated that Kyiv’s forces were continuing to gain ground in the Kursk region, taking another one to two kilometres on Wednesday. Russia’s defence ministry reported that 117 Ukrainian drones had been shot down within its territory overnight, and claimed to have repelled a series of Ukrainian attacks inside the Kursk region. The Ukrainian assault has dramatically changed the narrative around the two-and-a-half-year-old war, with Ukraine forcing nearly 200,000 Russians to evacuate border regions. Putin questioned what negotiations could occur with an enemy he accused of indiscriminately firing at Russian civilians and nuclear facilities. The Russian rouble weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, losing 8.5 percent since the start of the Ukrainian incursion. Zelenskiy has indicated that the incursion is meant to pressure Russian forces and “restore justice” after Russia’s invasion. However, this offensive brings risks for Kyiv, as it may leave other parts of the front on home soil exposed. Russian military bloggers expect Ukraine to make at least one more major move over the coming days.",Pakistan,Dawn,2024-08-14 19:14:54+0500
No spectators to be allowed at 2nd Pak-Bangladesh Test due to National Stadium renovation: PCB,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852245/no-spectators-to-be-allowed-at-2nd-pak-bangladesh-test-due-to-national-stadium-renovation-pcb,"This is an article by Dawn. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Wednesday that there will be no spectators for the second Test match between Pakistan and Bangladesh due to construction at Karachi’s National Bank Stadium in preparation for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. The second series is scheduled for August 30 to September 3, with the PCB stating that it was a “difficult decision” to hold the Test without an audience. “We understand the vital role that our passionate spectators play in cricket, providing inspiration and motivation to our players,” the board said. “However, the health and safety of our fans is our utmost priority. After careful consideration of all available options, we have decided that the safest course of action is to hold the second Test in front of an empty stadium.” Ticket sales have been suspended with immediate effect, and fans who have already purchased tickets will receive a full refund.

The renovations are part of the board’s commitment to making the venue more spectator-friendly and preparing it for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which will be the first ICC event hosted in Pakistan since 1996. The Bangladesh squad arrived in Lahore on Tuesday for the test series and were scheduled to train at Gaddafi Stadium from Aug 14 to 16 before travelling to Islamabad on Aug 17 to practice at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium from Aug 18 to 20. The opening Test will be played from Aug 21 to 25 in Rawalpindi.

Pakistan’s leaders, including President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, pledged to bring economic stability to Pakistan as the country celebrates 77 years of independence. Speaking at a flag-hoisting ceremony in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz vowed to work hard to reduce inflation and electricity prices as well as revamp Pakistan’s economy. He emphasized the need for self-introspection to correct past mistakes and called for a “fresh journey with new zeal” to steer the country out of existing crises. The premier highlighted that “hard work, honesty and passion” were essential for development and prosperity. He announced that the nation would soon hear good news regarding power bills and that a five-year economic programme would be launched.

President Zardari remarked that the day marked the culmination of the historic political struggle of Muslims in India for self-determination and called for unity and economic stability. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the people of India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine. PM Shehbaz also paid homage to the sacrifices of those who fought for Pakistan’s independence and reiterated support for Kashmiris and Palestinians.

Taliban celebrate 3 years since Afghanistan takeover with military show,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852243/taliban-celebrate-3-years-since-afghanistan-takeover-with-military-show,"This is an article by Dawn. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers celebrated three years in power on Wednesday with a military parade paying homage to their homemade bombs used in war, fighter aircraft, and goose-stepping security forces. The Taliban’s armed forces towed Soviet-era tanks and artillery pieces through the former US air base in Bagram, where Chinese and Iranian diplomats were among hundreds who gathered for the parade and speeches. Taliban forces seized the capital on August 15, 2021, after the US-backed government collapsed and its leaders fled into exile. Their government remains unrecognised by any other state, with restrictions on women, who bear the brunt of policies the United Nations has called “gender apartheid,” remaining a key sticking point. “Three years have passed since the dreams of girls have been buried,” said Madina, a 20-year-old university student in Kabul. Security has been a key priority for Taliban authorities as they consolidated their grip on power over the past three years, implementing laws based on their strict interpretation of Islam. However, attacks by the militant Islamic State group remain a threat, and extra security was deployed in Kabul and in the Taliban’s spiritual home of Kandahar ahead of the “day of victory.” A joint statement from international non-governmental groups warned of the growing aid funding gap, with 23.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Women have been squeezed from public life — banned from many jobs as well as parks and gyms — and barred from secondary and higher education. The third anniversary of the Taliban’s takeover is a grim reminder of Afghanistan’s human rights crisis, but it should also be a call for action, said Fereshta Abbasi, HRW’s Afghanistan researcher.",Pakistan,Dawn,2024-08-14 16:34:03+0500
Thai court dismisses Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin over cabinet appointment,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852239/thai-court-dismisses-prime-minister-srettha-thavisin-over-cabinet-appointment,"This is an article by Dawn. Thailand’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for appointing a former lawyer who served jail time to his cabinet, raising the spectre of more political upheaval and a reset of the governing alliance. Real estate tycoon Srettha becomes the fourth Thai premier in 16 years to be removed by verdicts by the same court, after it ruled he violated the constitution by appointing a minister who did not meet ethical standards. Srettha’s removal after less than a year in power means parliament must convene to choose a new premier, with the prospect of more uncertainty in a country dogged for two decades by coups and court rulings that have brought down multiple governments and political parties. The same court last week dissolved the anti-establishment Move Forward Party, the hugely popular opposition, ruling its campaign to reform a law against insulting the crown risked undermining the constitutional monarchy. Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged attempt to bribe court staff, was above board. Deputy Premier Phumtham Wechayachai is expected to take over as caretaker prime minister. According to some political experts, it is likely Pheu Thai would still have the clout to lead the next administration, after a period of horse-trading and uncertainty over who will be in charge. The next premier would need to have been nominated a prime ministerial candidate by their parties prior to the 2023 election, with Thaksin’s 37-year-old daughter and party leader Paetongtarn Shinawatra among Pheu Thai’s options. The court decision comes at a tricky time for an economy that Srettha struggled to jumpstart, with weak exports and consumer spending, sky-high household debt and more than a million small businesses unable to access loans.",Pakistan,Dawn,2024-08-14 19:02:10+0500
Unpopular Japan PM Kishida to step down,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852232/unpopular-japan-pm-kishida-to-step-down,"This is an article by Dawn. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced on Wednesday he will step aside next month, ending a three-year term plagued by low popularity ratings and a spluttering economy. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed almost uninterrupted for decades, is due to hold a leadership contest next month, with the winner to become prime minister. Kishida said on Wednesday he will not seek re-election as party chief, emphasizing the need for the LDP to show it is changing. He has seen his and his party’s poll ratings slide sharply in response to rising prices and several scandals. In November, Kishida announced a stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen to ease inflation pressures, but this failed to improve his popularity. Kishida won praise abroad for his support of Ukraine and efforts to strengthen Japan's defense policy, but internal party dissent grew, especially after the LDP lost three by-elections in April. Analysts suggest that the upcoming leadership battle will be influenced by the need for a candidate who resonates with voters. Potential successors include digital minister Taro Kono and economic security minister Sanae Takaichi, among others.

KARACHI: Army Chief Gen Asim Munir on Tuesday blamed foreign powers for a wave of ‘digital terrorism’, which he said aimed to create a gulf between state institutions and the people of Pakistan. Calling anti-terror activities under the umbrella of vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ the need of the hour, Gen Munir vowed that elements trying to create such rifts would only reap disappointment. In a wide-ranging speech at a parade held to mark Independence Day at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, he addressed key issues, such as the situation on the Western border with Afghanistan, the threat posed by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the situation in Balochistan.

Gen Munir stressed the importance of investigating and verifying information to avoid causing consternation among the people. He also said that while the Constitution allows for freedom of speech, it contains clear limits to what constitutes free speech. Maintaining that Pakistan desired good relations with its Western neighbor, he called on the Afghan Taliban not to prefer the banned terror group TTP over its long-standing neighbor. He declared that since these terrorist groups did not accept Sharia or the Constitution of Pakistan, the country would not consider them Pakistani.

Referring to the situation in Balochistan, Gen Munir vowed that the army and the governments at the Centre and in the province were committed to ensuring the security and welfare of the Baloch people. He thanked friendly countries for standing by Pakistan in trying times and called attention to the plight of the Kashmiris, reaffirming support for their right to self-determination.",Pakistan,Dawn,2024-08-14 09:46:07+0500

ISLAMABAD: Former information minister Muhammad Ali Durrani has launched efforts to unite opposition parties on the one-point agenda of securing Imran Khan’s release from prison. The move has come as a surprise to many as Mr. Durrani is traditionally considered close to the establishment, having been a minister in the cabinet of former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf. After remaining absent from the political scene for several years, he re-emerged ahead of the February 8 general elections.

Those in attendance included PTI leaders Asad Qaiser, Omar Ayub, and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, among others. According to a statement, leaders of the opposition parties agreed to work to get political prisoners released from jail and to further enhance their cooperation to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law.

According to the charging documents, Schultz provided dozens of sensitive US military documents to an individual living in Hong Kong who he believed to be associated with the Chinese government. He was paid $42,000 for the information. Among the documents handed over by Schultz was one discussing the lessons learned by the US Army from the Ukraine-Russia war that it would apply in a defense of Taiwan.

LAHORE: Indian forces shot dead an unidentified man who allegedly strayed across the border on the eve of Independence Day. Sources said the incident occurred near the border village of Hadyara, on the outskirts of Lahore. India’s Border Security Force (BSF) claimed that the man was trying to infiltrate into India before he was shot and killed, and tried to turn over the body to Pakistani authorities. However, Pakistan Rangers have refused to receive the body before a thorough investigation into the incident to establish the man’s identity, as per the Standard Operating Procedures devised by the two sides for the international border. According to the SOPs, border forces of both sides are supposed to be on the lookout for locals who inadvertently cross the border, and are supposed to return such individuals to the opposite side after satisfying themselves that the crossing was made inadvertently. There have been several cases in the past where Pakistani authorities have returned Indian citizens who strayed across the international boundary, and vice versa. But in the present case, Indian forces seemed to show little restraint before gunning down the man who allegedly crossed over into their territory. Sources said that BSF claimed they had first tried to alert the man, and then opened fire when he ignored their warnings, killing him on the spot. Discussions between the BSF and Pakistan Rangers on the matter continued until late on Tuesday night, sources said.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday expressed concern over Rs500 billion lost each year to electricity theft and stressed the need to reduce power prices to provide relief to both domestic consumers and industries. He mentioned that the government is working to provide low-cost electricity and bring in reforms for economic stability. Discussions are ongoing with China about using locally sourced coal in power plants, which currently rely on more expensive imported coal. PM Shehbaz is set to announce a comprehensive economic reform plan aimed at reducing average tariffs on imports to over 14 percent to drive export-led growth. He attributed much of the electricity theft to collusion with employees of power distribution companies and emphasized that reducing theft should be a top priority. The circular debt has surged to Rs2.3 trillion, representing nearly one-third of the country’s total receipts last year. The prime minister ordered the immediate implementation of smart metering in some distribution companies and highlighted ongoing negotiations with China to save the country $1 billion annually. The reform agenda follows recommendations from two task forces focused on sustainable economic development and tariff rationalization. The proposed tariff reductions could increase import volumes and boost government revenue, with potential increases in exports projected.

National identity and national security,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852207/national-identity-and-national-security,"This is an article by Dawn. On the 77th anniversary of Pakistan’s independence, a brief exploration of the relationship between national identity and national security reveals that a strong national identity correlates with stable national security. However, historical examples, such as the experiences of China and Egypt, suggest that national identity alone may not be sufficient to prevent foreign domination. The concept of ‘nation’ has evolved significantly, particularly influenced by the Treaty of Westphalia, the World Wars, the end of colonial empires, and the establishment of the United Nations. In Pakistan, two views of national identity exist: one rooted in a long historical process and another that perceives Pakistan as an “overnight nation.” Despite skepticism regarding the legitimacy of Pakistani nationalism, the desire for a distinct Muslim identity persists, as evidenced by the sentiments of Bangladeshis post-1971. The political landscape in Pakistan has largely favored parties with a unifying vision rather than those based on ethnic or sectarian lines. National identity and national security are interconnected, with elements such as the will to survive and the capacity to confront internal and external threats being crucial. Pakistan's geopolitical challenges, particularly with India and Afghanistan, further complicate its national security landscape. Ultimately, a holistic approach is needed to align national identity with national security, especially in the context of evolving global dynamics.",Pakistan,Dawn,2024-08-14 17:03:34+0500

The cabinet also approved a model house for the “Apni Chhat, Apna Ghar” project, under which Rs1.5 million will be given to beneficiaries for the construction of a five-marla house in urban areas and a 10-marla house in rural areas. Additionally, a project to run electric buses in Lahore was approved, with 27 buses expected to arrive in Pakistan by December 2024. The cabinet also agreed to establish the Punjab Grid Company for direct electricity supply to industries and considered providing affordable electricity to the Industrial Park through direct transmission lines from Bhiki, Balloki, and Quaid-i-Azam Solar Park. An amendment to the Registration Act 1908 was approved to facilitate revenue services for Overseas Pakistanis in eight countries, including China, Saudi Arabia, and the USA. The cabinet also approved the Punjab government’s advertisement policy and a feasibility study for a glass train aimed at tourists between Rawalpindi and Murree. Meanwhile, the cabinet meeting included Minister for Mines and Minerals Sardar Sher Ali Gorchani, who is under scrutiny for corruption allegations. CM Maryam had previously announced a committee to investigate the matter and ordered Gorchani to explain his position regarding the allegations. However, no committee was formed, nor was a show-cause notice issued to him.",Pakistan,Dawn,2024-08-14 08:00:51+0500
Middle East peace hinges on Gaza ceasefire,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852168/middle-east-peace-hinges-on-gaza-ceasefire,"This is an article by Dawn. TEHRAN: Iran on Tuesday rejected Western calls to stand down its threat to retaliate against Israel for the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and said only a ceasefire in Gaza could stop the country from direct retaliation. In a statement on Monday, the US and its European allies urged Iran to de-escalate. Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanani, criticized the Western call for restraint. “The declaration by France, Germany and Britain, which raised no objection to the international crimes of the Zionist regime, brazenly asks Iran to take no deterrent action against a regime which has violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Amid heightened tensions, Iran also held a second military drill in the past three days in the north of the country. The drill took place on Tuesday in Iran’s Gilan province on the Caspian Sea. A senior Iranian security official told Reuters that Iran, along with allies such as Hezbollah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks fail or it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. The US ambassador to Turkiye confirmed that Washington was asking allies to help convince Iran to de-escalate tensions. In the latest Gaza violence, an Israeli strike killed 10 members of one family in the territory’s southern district of Khan Yunis, leaving only one survivor — a three-month-old girl.",Pakistan,Dawn,2024-08-14 14:45:19+0500
"Ukraine is advancing deeper into Russia, Zelenskiy says",https://www.dawn.com/news/1852254/ukraine-is-advancing-deeper-into-russia-zelenskiy-says,"This is an article by Dawn. Ukraine said on Wednesday its forces had advanced further into Russia’s Kursk region in the biggest foreign incursion into Russia since World War Two, posing a dilemma for President Vladimir Putin according to US President Joe Biden. Thousands of Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of August 6 into Russia’s western Kursk region in what Putin called a major provocation aimed at gaining a stronger hand in possible future ceasefire talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy stated that Kyiv’s forces were continuing to gain ground in the Kursk region, taking another one to two kilometres on Wednesday. Russia’s defence ministry reported that 117 Ukrainian drones had been shot down within its territory overnight, and claimed to have repelled a series of Ukrainian attacks inside the Kursk region. The Ukrainian assault into Russian territory has dramatically changed the narrative around the two-and-a-half-year-old war, with Biden noting that it had “created a real dilemma” for Putin. The White House indicated that Ukraine gave no advance notice of its incursion and the United States had no involvement, although Russian officials suggested that Ukraine’s Western backers must have known of the attack. By bringing the war to Russia, Ukraine has forced nearly 200,000 Russians to evacuate border regions. Zelenskiy has stated that the incursion is meant to pressure Russian forces and “restore justice” after Russia’s invasion. However, the offensive brings risks for Kyiv, as it may leave other parts of the front on home soil exposed. Russian military bloggers have indicated that they expect Ukraine to make at least one more major move over the coming days.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 19:14:54+0500

President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday announced the conferment of national awards for 104 Pakistanis and foreigners in recognition of their services, excellence, and sacrifices in their respective fields. The awards were announced on Pakistan’s 78th Independence Day and will be presented at an investiture ceremony on Pakistan Day, March 23, 2025. The president conferred awards in various fields including science, engineering, education, medicine, arts, literature, sports, and public services.

Taliban celebrate 3 years since Afghanistan takeover with military show,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852243/taliban-celebrate-3-years-since-afghanistan-takeover-with-military-show,"This is an article by Dawn. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers celebrated three years in power on Wednesday with a military parade paying homage to their homemade bombs used in war, fighter aircraft, and goose-stepping security forces. The Taliban’s armed forces towed Soviet-era tanks and artillery pieces through the former US air base in Bagram, where Chinese and Iranian diplomats were among hundreds who gathered for the parade and speeches. Taliban forces seized the capital on August 15, 2021, after the US-backed government collapsed and its leaders fled into exile. Their government remains unrecognised by any other state, with restrictions on women, who bear the brunt of policies the United Nations has called “gender apartheid,” remaining a key sticking point. “Three years have passed since the dreams of girls have been buried,” said Madina, a 20-year-old university student in Kabul. Security has been a key priority for Taliban authorities as they consolidated their grip on power over the past three years, implementing laws based on their strict interpretation of Islam. However, attacks by the militant Islamic State group remain a threat, and extra security was deployed in Kabul and in the Taliban’s spiritual home of Kandahar ahead of the “day of victory.” A joint statement from international non-governmental groups warned of the growing aid funding gap, with 23.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Women have been squeezed from public life — banned from many jobs as well as parks and gyms — and barred from secondary and higher education. The third anniversary of the Taliban’s takeover is a grim reminder of Afghanistan’s human rights crisis, but it should also be a call for action, said Fereshta Abbasi, HRW’s Afghanistan researcher.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 16:34:03+0500
Unpopular Japan PM Kishida to step down,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852232/unpopular-japan-pm-kishida-to-step-down,"This is an article by Dawn. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced on Wednesday he will step aside next month, ending a three-year term plagued by low popularity ratings and a spluttering economy. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed almost uninterrupted for decades, is due to hold a leadership contest next month, with the winner to become prime minister. Kishida said on Wednesday he will not seek re-election as party chief, emphasizing the need for the LDP to show it is changing. He has seen his and his party’s poll ratings slide sharply in response to rising prices and several scandals. In November, Kishida announced a stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen to ease inflation pressures, but this failed to improve his popularity. Kishida won praise abroad for his support of Ukraine and efforts to strengthen Japan's defense policy, but internal party dissent grew, especially after the LDP lost three by-elections in April. Analysts suggest that the upcoming leadership battle will be influenced by the need for a candidate who resonates with voters. Potential successors include digital minister Taro Kono and economic security minister Sanae Takaichi, who could become Japan’s first female premier. Voter sentiment indicates a desire for change, with calls for younger leadership emerging.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 12:59:23+0500

A US Army intelligence analyst pleaded guilty on Tuesday to providing sensitive defense information to China, including documents about US weapons systems and military tactics and strategy. Sergeant Korbein Schultz, who held a top-secret security clearance, was arrested in March at Fort Campbell, a military base on the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Schultz pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to obtain and disclose national defense information, exporting technical data related to defense articles without a license, conspiracy to export defense articles without a license, and bribery of a public official. According to the charging documents, Schultz provided dozens of sensitive US military documents to an individual living in Hong Kong who he believed to be associated with the Chinese government. He was paid $42,000 for the information. Among the documents handed over by Schultz was one discussing the lessons learned by the US Army from the Ukraine-Russia war that it would apply in a defense of Taiwan. Other documents discussed Chinese military tactics and preparedness and US military exercises and forces in South Korea and the Philippines. Schultz potentially faces decades in prison, with a sentencing hearing scheduled for Jan 23, 2025.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 13:07:35+0500
Thai court dismisses Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin over cabinet appointment,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852239/thai-court-dismisses-prime-minister-srettha-thavisin-over-cabinet-appointment,"This is an article by Dawn. Thailand’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for appointing a former lawyer who served jail time to his cabinet, raising the spectre of more political upheaval and a reset of the governing alliance. Real estate tycoon Srettha becomes the fourth Thai premier in 16 years to be removed by verdicts from the same court, after it ruled he violated the constitution by appointing a minister who did not meet ethical standards. Srettha’s removal after less than a year in power means parliament must convene to choose a new premier, with the prospect of more uncertainty in a country dogged for two decades by coups and court rulings that have brought down multiple governments and political parties. The same court last week dissolved the anti-establishment Move Forward Party, ruling its campaign to reform a law against insulting the crown risked undermining the constitutional monarchy. Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008, was above board. Deputy Premier Phumtham Wechayachai is expected to take over as caretaker prime minister. According to some political experts, it is likely Pheu Thai would still have the clout to lead the next administration, after a period of horse-trading and uncertainty over who will be in charge. The next premier would need to have been nominated a prime ministerial candidate by their parties prior to the 2023 election, with Thaksin’s daughter and party leader Paetongtarn Shinawatra among Pheu Thai’s options. The court decision comes at a tricky time for an economy that Srettha struggled to jumpstart, with weak exports and consumer spending, sky-high household debt, and more than a million small businesses unable to access loans.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 19:02:10+0500

Bangladesh court opens murder case against Sheikh Hasina,https://www.dawn.com/news/1852160/bangladesh-court-opens-murder-case-against-sheikh-hasina,"This is an article by Dawn. DHAKA: While a court in Bangladesh opened a murder investigation into ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and six top figures in her administration on Tuesday, the ex-premier in her first public statement since her abrupt resignation demanded an investigation into the protests that led to her ouster. On the other hand, the White House announced that the United States “had no involvement” in ousting Sheikh Hasina, describing her previous claim as “simply false”. Hasina, 76, quit as prime minister on August 5 after a student-led uprising against her government and fled by helicopter to longtime ally India a week ago, where she remains, as protesters flooded Dhaka streets in a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure. More than 450 people were killed during the weeks of unrest leading up to her toppling. “A case has been filed against Sheikh Hasina and six more,” said Mamun Mia, a lawyer who brought the case on behalf of a private citizen. The case accuses the seven of responsibility for the death of a grocery store owner who was shot dead on July 19 by police violently suppressing protests. Hasina’s government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of thousands of her political opponents. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus returned from Europe three days after Hasina’s ouster to head a temporary administration facing the monumental challenge of steering democratic reforms. The new administration has stressed it wants to put Bangladesh on a different path. Foreign Minister Touhid Hossain told a briefing of more than 60 foreign diplomats it was “very serious about human rights,” and vowed not to “allow any violence or damages to occur.”",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 09:20:07+0500

KYIV: Ukraine now controls 74 settlements in Russia’s Kursk border region, the country’s president Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday. The governor of the Kursk region, where Ukraine is mounting a week-long incursion, previously said on Monday that Ukraine controls 28 settlements. “There are 74 settlements under the control of Ukraine,” Zelensky said in his evening address. He stated that “despite difficult, intense fighting, the advance of our forces in the Kursk region continues.” Zelensky mentioned that Ukraine has been able to “replenish” its numbers of Russian POWs to exchange for its own troops and that “preparation for our next steps continues.” Military chief Oleksandr Syrsky reported that Ukrainian troops have advanced in some areas by 1 to 3 kilometres and have taken control of “40 square kilometres of territory” in the last day. He added that the troops hold around 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory. “Fighting is ongoing along the entire front line. The situation is under control despite the high intensity of fighting,” Syrsky said. Kyiv stated that its biggest cross-border assault of the war to date would prevent Russia from sending more troops to fight in its eastern Donetsk region and disrupt military logistics.

A far-right Israeli minister prayed with thousands of Jews at the Al Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem on Tuesday, defying a ban on Jewish prayer at the flashpoint site and drawing global condemnation. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government’s longstanding ban, vowed to “defeat Hamas” in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit. The visit comes at a tense time during the 10-month Israeli aggression in Gaza, with faltering efforts for a ceasefire and Israel braced for retaliation from Iran. Ben Gvir’s latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations.

Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the UN was “against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites.” US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters that the actions were “unacceptable” and detracted from efforts to secure a ceasefire. On Tuesday morning, Ben Gvir and about 2,250 other Israelis walked through the compound, singing Jewish hymns under police protection. Israeli police also imposed restrictions on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, with more than 700 Jews praying there in the afternoon. Jordan’s foreign ministry condemned the “storming” of the mosque, calling it a “flagrant violation of international law.” The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation “strongly condemned” the incident, labeling it a “provocation to the feelings of Muslims all over the world.”",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 09:32:22+0500
"War crimes escalating in Myanmar, says UN",https://www.dawn.com/news/1852161/war-crimes-escalating-in-myanmar-says-un,"This is an article by Dawn. GENEVA: Crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by the Myanmar military have “escalated at an alarming rate,” UN investigators warned on Tuesday, citing systematic torture, gang rape, and abuses against children. The United Nations’ Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) said that in the last six months, more than three million people are estimated to have been forced to flee their homes, as conflict spirals within the country. “We have collected substantial evidence showing horrific levels of brutality and inhumanity across Myanmar,” said IIMM chief Nicholas Koumjian. 

In its annual report, covering July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the IIMM said the conflict in Myanmar had “escalated substantially” in that time, “with reports of more frequent and brutal crimes committed across the country.” The investigators noted significant evidence of more intensive and violent war crimes, including aerial attacks on schools, religious buildings, and hospitals, with no apparent military target. They also cited physical mutilations against detainees, including beheadings and public displays of disfigured and sexually mutilated bodies. The IIMM reported that thousands of people have been arrested, with many tortured or killed in detention. Myanmar’s ruling junta came to power in the February 2021 coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, ending a 10-year experiment with democracy and plunging the Southeast Asian nation into bloody turmoil.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 09:44:06+0500

A study released on Monday using data from Nasa’s Mars InSight lander shows evidence of liquid water far below the surface of the fourth planet, advancing the search for life there and showing what might have happened to Mars’ ancient oceans. The lander, which has been on the Red Planet since 2018, measured seismic data over four years, examining how quakes shook the ground and determining what materials or substances were beneath the surface. Based on that data, the researchers found liquid water was most likely present deep beneath the lander. Water is considered essential for life, and geological studies show the planet’s surface had lakes, rivers, and oceans more than 3 billion years ago. “On Earth what we know is where it is wet enough and there are enough sources of energy, there is microbial life very deep in Earth’s subsurface,” said one of the authors, Vashan Wright of the University of California San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “The ingredients for life as we know it exist in the Martian subsurface if these interpretations are correct.” The study found that large reservoirs of liquid water in fractures 11.5 kilometres to 20km beneath the surface best explained the InSight measurements.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-14 09:41:32+0500

Africa’s top public health body declared a “public health emergency of continental security” over an outbreak of monkeypox that has spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighbouring countries. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) warned of an alarming rate of spread of the viral infection, which is transmitted through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. Most cases are mild, but it can be fatal. Director General Jean Kaseya stated that the declaration aims to mobilise resources to act swiftly and decisively. The outbreak in Congo began with an endemic strain, Clade I, but the new variant, Clade Ib, spreads more easily, particularly among children. Kaseya noted that the continent needs over 10 million doses of the vaccine, but only about 200,000 are currently available. He assured that the Africa CDC would work to increase the supply, starting with 3 million doses in 2024. This year, more than 15,000 cases and 461 deaths have been reported on the continent, marking a 160 percent increase from last year. Monkeypox has been endemic in parts of Africa since it was first detected in humans in 1970.

An Indian would-be social media star has been arrested and detained after outrage by his video of cooking and eating the country’s protected national bird, a peacock, police said. Police said that Kodam Pranay Kumar was detained on Monday and sent to jail after “other videos in his mobile phone confirmed” that the bird he’d cooked for his curry dish video was indeed a peacock. The colourful birds are protected under stringent wildlife laws. “He is now in jail on 14 days remand under the Wildlife Protection Act and now the court would decide whether he’d remain inside or get a bail,” Akhil Mahajan, police superintendent in Telangana told AFP. Investigators are also trying to ascertain how and where Kumar managed to get a peacock for the video, which has since been removed from his channel. The video showed him cooking peacock curry, “a stunt allegedly pulled to attract more views,” The Times of India reported. “However, the response was far from what he might have anticipated,” it added. “Social media users condemned the video, accusing Kumar of promoting illegal wildlife consumption and disrespecting a national symbol.” The Indian peacock holds a special symbolic importance in India, with its vibrant blue colour and regal wingspan.

",https://www.dawn.com/news/1851941/us-lifts-restrictions-on-saudi-weapons-with-eye-on-resolving-gaza-crisis,"This is an article by Dawn. The United States confirmed on Monday it would resume sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia, as concerns over human rights in the kingdom’s Yemen war give way to US hopes for it to play a role in resolving the conflict in Gaza. More than three years after imposing limits on human rights grounds over Saudi strikes in Yemen, the State Department said it would return to weapons sales “in regular order, with appropriate congressional notification and consultation.” US President Joe Biden took office in 2021 pledging a new approach to Saudi Arabia that emphasized human rights, and immediately announced that the administration would only send “defensive” weaponry to the longtime US arms customer. The United States is again hoping for support from Arab partners as Iran threatens another reprisal against Israel over the killing in Tehran of Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. The step came after thousands of civilians — including children — were estimated to be killed in Saudi-led airstrikes against Houthi rebels, who have taken over much of Yemen. Geopolitical considerations have, however, changed markedly since then. The United Nations, with US support, brokered a truce in Yemen in early 2022 that has largely held. Since the truce, “there has not been a single Saudi airstrike into Yemen and cross-border fire from Yemen into Saudi Arabia has largely stopped,” Patel said. In a bid to find a long-term solution, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has repeatedly traveled to Saudi Arabia to discuss a package of US incentives if the kingdom recognizes Israel. Saudi Arabia has sought US security guarantees, a continued flow of weapons, and potentially a civilian nuclear deal if it normalizes with Israel.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 12:23:30+0500

Donald Trump ran through his checklist of conspiracy theories Monday in a conversation with Elon Musk that was initially derailed by a technical glitch. Trump vented about a “zombie apocalypse” of immigration, repeatedly criticized President Joe Biden, and mused about developing a new missile defense system. He dismissed climate change, claiming that rising sea levels would create more real estate opportunities. “The biggest threat is not global warming... The biggest threat is nuclear warming,” he stated, emphasizing concerns over nuclear power in several countries. 

The conversation, which started late due to technical issues, was intended to help reinvigorate Trump’s campaign amid rising competition from Kamala Harris. Musk, who has shifted his support to Trump after a recent assassination attempt on the former president, noted that the technical difficulties illustrated opposition to Trump’s message. Trump frequently boasted about his relationships with autocrats and insisted America would be safer under his leadership.

TEHRAN: Iran’s former foreign minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with major world powers, on Monday announced he had resigned from his new post as vice president. “To avoid any suspicions or excuses for disrupting the work of the government… I resigned from the position of vice president for strategic affairs last week,” Zarif said on social media platform X, less than two weeks after newly-elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian chose him as his deputy. Zarif cited several reasons for his resignation, most notably his disappointment with the line-up in the newly-proposed 19-member cabinet. “I am ashamed that I could not implement, in a decent way, the expert opinion of the committees (responsible for selecting candidates) and achieve the inclusion of women, youth and ethnic groups, as I had promised,” he said. Pezeshkian on Sunday presented his cabinet, which included one woman, to parliament for approval. The proposed list drew criticism from some among Iran’s reformist camp, including over the inclusion of conservatives from the government of late President Ebrahim Raisi. Zarif pointed out that he also faced pressure after his appointment as vice president because his children hold US citizenship. An Iranian law enacted in October 2022 prohibits the appointment of those “who themselves, their children or their spouse have dual citizenship” to sensitive jobs and positions.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 11:16:02+0500
"Indonesian president holds first cabinet meeting in future capital
",https://www.dawn.com/news/1851951/indonesian-president-holds-first-cabinet-meeting-in-future-capital,"This is an article by Dawn. Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Monday held his first cabinet meeting in the country’s future capital, despite much of the city remaining under construction as it runs behind schedule. The $32-billion megaproject Nusantara was widely expected to be inaugurated on August 17, Indonesia’s Independence Day, but building delays and funding woes have cast doubt on the schedule. Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, still hailed the city-in-progress, which is expected to be fully ready in 2045. “Not all countries have the opportunity, have the ability to build their capital starting from zero,” he said. According to Jokowi, the city is “being built with the concept of a forest city, a jungle city, a city full of green” in eastern Borneo island. But environmentalists have warned the rapid development of the new capital will hasten deforestation in one of the world’s largest stretches of tropical rainforest. Jokowi — who started to work from the future capital several weeks ago — brought several officials to Nusantara for the cabinet meeting, including his successor Prabowo Subianto. Prabowo pledged to continue the capital-to-be once he takes office in October, removing any doubt over his willingness to carry out Jokowi’s legacy project. Jokowi resurrected the long-shelved plan to relocate the capital soon after taking office in 2019 after experts warned Jakarta — the megacity of 12 million people — was sinking.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 07:58:56+0500

A massive wildfire blazed into Athens’ northeastern suburbs on Monday as hundreds of firefighters battled to contain it, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes and sparking a Greek government appeal for international help. Residents wearing masks against the choking smoke were desperately dousing their homes with water hoses in the suburbs of Nea Penteli and Vrilissia. “(It’s) the first time ever the fire has come here,” said Melina Kritseli, a civil servant living in a nearby suburb. Television footage showed several cars gutted by fire and the roofs of homes burning as water-bombing helicopters roared overhead. “The situation is dramatic,” Penteli mayor Natassa Kosmopoulou said, noting that a school and homes were on fire. Greece formally called for EU assistance, with several countries, including Italy and France, sending units to help. The wildfire started on Sunday afternoon in Varnavas and grew to a 30-kilometre long frontline of flames. Over 700 firefighters and nearly 200 fire engines were deployed to contain the fire, while authorities opened stadiums to house evacuees. Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 07:58:56+0500
"700 migrants reach Britain on 11 boats
",https://www.dawn.com/news/1851947/700-migrants-reach-britain-on-11-boats,"This is an article by Dawn. Over 700 migrants in small boats crossed the Channel to Britain on Sunday, the highest number on a single day since Prime Minister Keir Starmer took power vowing to tackle people-smugglers. Two migrants who attempted the crossing died, French authorities said earlier, taking the number of people to lose their life on the dangerous sea journey to 25 since the start of the year. Some 703 people arrived on Sunday on 11 boats, according to provisional interior ministry figures released on Monday. Stopping the small boat arrivals was a key issue in Britain’s general election in July. Within days of taking power, Starmer scrapped a controversial scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda. Starmer has instead pledged to dismantle the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant. The latest figures come after the UK has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant. Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across Britain on Saturday against riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration. Starmer and France’s President Emmanuel Macron have pledged to strengthen “cooperation” in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 10:56:13+0500
"Police take control of Dhaka streets

Bangladeshi police resumed patrols of the capital Dhaka on Monday, ending a weeklong strike that followed the abrupt ouster of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina. Officers had vanished from the streets after Hasina’s resignation and flight abroad, which ended her 15-year rule. The police had vowed not to return until their safety was guaranteed but agreed to resume work after talks with the new interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. Student-led protests against Hasina’s government had been largely peaceful until police attempted to violently disperse them. Yunus described the situation as a “revolution” after the collapse of the government, stating he was instructed by student leaders to take office. Several top allies of Hasina resigned following ultimatums from students, although Yunus claimed their resignations were legal. In the absence of police, students volunteered to restore order, acting as traffic wardens and forming neighborhood watch patrols. Meanwhile, India has arrested nearly a dozen Bangladeshis attempting to flee the violence and political turmoil following Hasina's ouster, with hundreds more waiting at the border for permission to cross.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 10:51:40+0500
"US fears Iran attack on Israel ‘this week’
",https://www.dawn.com/news/1851967/us-fears-iran-attack-on-israel-this-week,"This is an article by Dawn. Concerns over a wider conflict in the Middle East have prompted international airlines to suspend flights to the region or avoid affected airspace, as US officials prepare for potential significant attacks by Iran or its allies. The Pentagon has dispatched a guided missile submarine to the region, and an aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln is en route. This follows Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's warning to US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin about Iran's preparations for a large-scale military attack on Israel. The situation escalated after Iran and Hezbollah vowed to retaliate for the killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr. President Joe Biden held discussions with leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to address the tensions, reaffirming support for Israel's defense. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby indicated that the US is prepared for significant attacks, sharing Israeli assessments that an attack could occur this week. Meanwhile, at least 17 airlines, including Lufthansa and Easyjet, have suspended flights in the region, with Air France extending its suspension of flights to Beirut. Iran also showcased its long-range Mohajer-10 drones at a defense exhibit in Russia, amid accusations from US officials of Iran supplying drones to Russia for use in Ukraine. The Mohajer-10 is reported to have an operational range of 2,000 km and a payload capacity of 300 kg.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 08:51:02+0500

BARCELONA: Spain’s ruling Socialists regained control of Catalonia’s regional government as a new cabinet was sworn in on Monday, ending over a decade of separatist rule in the region. The 16-member cabinet is led by Salvador Illa, who was Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s health minister during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I want to assure you that the government will govern for all, this is a real obsession,” Illa said during the swearing-in ceremony. It is the first time since 2010 that the wealthy northeastern region has a government that does not come from the pro-independence camp. The Socialists won the most seats in a regional election in May, but fell short of a majority. Illa secured the support of the tiny far-left Comuns party — part of the Sumar alliance that backs Sanchez at national level — and moderate separatist ERC party to become regional leader in a vote on Thursday in Catalonia’s regional assembly. Forming a government in Catalonia will be seen as a vindication of Sanchez’s strategy of trying to tamp down support for separatism in the region by offering concessions, including a controversial amnesty for those involved in an illegal independence referendum in 2017 that triggered Spain’s worst political crisis in decades.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 07:58:56+0500

Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement reported that an Israeli air strike on Sunday killed two of its fighters, with the health ministry also noting another death from a previous attack. Since Hamas's raid on Israel on October 7, Hezbollah has engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire with Israel. A recent strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs resulted in the death of Hezbollah’s top military commander, Fuad Shukr, shortly before the assassination of Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The Lebanese health ministry confirmed that an Israeli strike in the village of Taybeh resulted in two deaths, which Hezbollah identified as its fighters. The Israeli military stated it had targeted several Hezbollah military structures in the area. Additionally, at least one Lebanese and 11 Syrians were reported wounded in an Israeli strike on Maaroub. Hezbollah retaliated by launching rockets at Israeli troops, with the Israeli military reporting no casualties but confirming retaliatory strikes. The ongoing violence has resulted in at least 565 deaths in Lebanon, primarily among fighters, but also including civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau advised Canadians to leave Lebanon due to the escalating conflict, warning that evacuation may not be possible if the situation deteriorates further.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-13 07:58:56+0500

International pressure mounted on Monday for a ceasefire in Gaza as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and the United Nations pressed for an end to fighting between Israel and Hamas without further delay. The calls came a day after Hamas urged mediators to implement a truce plan presented by US President Joe Biden instead of holding more talks. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated, “The people of Gaza need urgent and unfettered delivery and distribution of aid. There can be no further delay.” The Biden administration expressed expectations for Gaza peace talks to move forward, believing that a ceasefire agreement is still possible. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the continued loss of life and urged both sides to conclude a ceasefire and prisoner release deal. International mediators have invited Israel and Hamas to resume talks towards a truce and prisoner-release deal. Israel has accepted the invitation to send negotiators for talks planned for Thursday. Hamas expressed a desire for the implementation of Biden's plan, which includes a full ceasefire and the release of prisoners.

London’s Metropolitan Police said on Monday a 32-year-old man was arrested after an 11-year-old girl was “seriously injured” in a stabbing in Leicester Square in the city centre. The young victim will require further treatment in hospital but her condition is “not life-threatening,” while her 34-year-old mother also suffered minor injuries. The police stated that the 32-year-old man was arrested at the scene and that officers were not looking for anyone else in connection with the attack. “An urgent investigation is now ongoing and detectives are working to establish the details around exactly what happened,” Detective Chief Superintendent Christina Jessah said. “At this stage, we don’t believe the suspect and the victims were known to each other.” 

The stabbing took place in an area heavily frequented by tourists and shoppers. A security guard intervened and took a knife from the attacker, who was described as a “young, white, skinny male wearing a black T-shirt and jeans.” Witnesses reported that the suspect focused the attack on the girl, putting her in a headlock and stabbing her.

Elon Musk to interview Donald Trump on X,https://www.dawn.com/news/1851846/elon-musk-to-interview-donald-trump-on-x,"This is an article by Dawn. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is due to interview Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on the X social media network on Monday in an event that could inject more surprises into the turbulent US presidential election. The interview, scheduled for 8pm Eastern Time, could provide the former president an opportunity to seize the limelight at a time when his campaign is seen as sagging. His Democratic rival for the November 5 election, Vice President Kamala Harris, has erased Trump’s lead in opinion polls and energized Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies. The interview on Musk’s social media platform could allow Trump to reach a different audience than the conservative faithful who attend his rallies and watch his interviews on Fox News. However, similar events on the platform have been plagued by technical problems. 

The interview will be hosted live using Trump’s official X account, his campaign said on Sunday. Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social platform, which was launched in February 2022. Musk could prove to be an unusual interviewer, having backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but later endorsing Trump. Musk, who heads Tesla Inc, also started a fundraising organization to support Trump’s campaign, which is now under investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws. The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.",Global News,Dawn,2024-08-12 23:22:13+0500

France bid a reluctant farewell on Monday to an “enchanted” fortnight of Olympic sport as athletes headed home from Paris, praising a dazzling edition of the Games. Hollywood star Tom Cruise delivered stardust at the closing ceremony by abseiling into the national stadium, delighting thousands of athletes and fans. The final act of the Paris Olympics brought relief that the event, initially overshadowed by worries about terror attacks and protests, had passed off smoothly. However, there was also sadness that two weeks of celebration had come to an end. The front-page headline of France’s biggest sports newspaper urged the public to “keep the flame alive” and maintain the spirit of the Games. Athletes were packing their bags at the Athletes’ Village, with the main airports bracing for a huge influx of travelers. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach praised the Paris Games for being “sport at its best,” calling them “sensational.” Observers noted the uplifting impact of the Games on the national mood in France, transforming a nation of complainers into enthusiastic supporters.

OnePlus’ Pad 2 has a sharp display with a price tag that stings  ,https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24214545/oneplus-pad-2-android-tablet-review,"This is an article by The Verge. As an entertainment device, the new OnePlus Pad 2 shines. The display is dazzling, and its speakers are top-notch, making it more powerful than its predecessor for watching movies, listening to music, and playing games. However, it falls short as a productivity device, especially with its increased price of $549.99, which makes it harder to compete with similar Android tablets. The Pad 2 features a higher 144Hz variable refresh rate and a 3K LCD screen that supports Dolby Vision, providing a bright and crisp display. Despite its impressive specs, the tablet's weight makes it uncomfortable for long periods of use. 

While the audio experience is enhanced with six speakers and OnePlus’s version of spatial audio, the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack is a downside. The multitasking capabilities are limited compared to Apple and Samsung tablets, and many Android apps are not optimized for larger displays. The OnePlus Smart Keyboard is decent but lacks sturdiness, and the stylus offers a better writing experience than previous models. Overall, the OnePlus Pad 2 excels in entertainment but struggles with productivity, and its price point may deter potential buyers.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-12 13:00:00-0400
Good luck with the PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter — you’ll need it,https://www.theverge.com/games/24216389/psvr2-pc-adapter-review,"This is an article by The Verge. The biggest problem with Sony’s PSVR 2 virtual reality headset is the lack of games. I had hoped Sony’s PC adapter would change that, especially with the opportunity to play Half-Life: Alyx, which is considered the best VR game yet. However, I cannot recommend the adapter; if I had purchased it, I would have requested a refund. The PSVR 2 is a good headset with impressive image quality, but my experience with Half-Life: Alyx was marred by glitches, including my hand becoming detached from my body during gameplay. 

Sony’s PC adapter connects to the PS5 with a single USB-C cable, but it only adapts the headset, leaving the controllers to connect via Bluetooth without any provided radio. This has led to a frustrating troubleshooting process, as I struggled to connect the controllers and faced issues with tracking and responsiveness. Even after purchasing a recommended Bluetooth adapter, I encountered persistent problems with controller tracking and the overall experience frequently freezing. 

Sony did not respond to my inquiries about their Bluetooth solution or troubleshooting assistance, leading me to conclude that their PC product is not ready for use. Additionally, the PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter requires users to agree to multiple terms and conditions, including data collection agreements, which adds to the frustration of the experience.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-12 09:00:00-0400
Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge review: beauty before brawn,https://www.theverge.com/24215509/samsung-galaxy-book4-edge-2024-review-qualcomm-copilot-plus-pc-snapdragon,"This is an article by The Verge. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon chips have quickly turned Windows on Arm into a viable platform, with even the least powerful chip matching Intel and last-gen AMD on CPU performance while surpassing them in battery life. The high-end Snapdragon X Elite X1E-84-100 chip is only available in Samsung’s Galaxy Book4 Edge, which is designed for web browsing and running Windows Copilot Plus AI apps. Despite its impressive specifications, Samsung underpowered the chip to maintain a thin chassis, resulting in a laptop that, while good, does not fully utilize the chip's potential. The Book4 Edge is one of the most portable 16-inch laptops, weighing under 3.5 pounds and measuring less than half an inch thick, making it easy to carry. Its build quality is solid, with a rigid metal chassis and a responsive keyboard, though the keys feel sluggish compared to competitors. The laptop performs well for everyday tasks, but its benchmark scores lag behind those of other laptops with lower-tier Snapdragon chips. Battery life is impressive, lasting around 14 hours on a relatively small battery, showcasing the efficiency of Qualcomm’s processors. The AMOLED display offers vibrant colors and sharp images while being power-efficient. Overall, the Galaxy Book4 Edge is a good option for students or casual users, but power users may find better performance in AMD or Intel machines. Despite its strengths, the laptop does not fully demonstrate the capabilities of Qualcomm’s most powerful chip.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-11 09:00:00-0400
The Tippy Type makes typing with long nails less tedious,https://www.theverge.com/24209704/tippy-type-review-keyboard-accessory,"This is an article by The Verge. Long nails can complicate everyday tasks, from opening soda cans to typing. Typing with long nails often results in slow speeds and numerous typos, especially on laptops where the keys are flat. This led to the discovery of the Tippy Type, a silicone keyboard cover designed for those with medium-to-long nails. It features cylindrical keys that allow typing with finger pads instead of nails, promising comfort and protection for manicures. 

While the Tippy Type has a learning curve due to its firmer keys, users can adapt quickly, with typing speeds improving significantly over time. However, it may not be suitable for those with extra-long nails, and some keys can be difficult to press. Currently, it is only available for MacBooks, but plans for other brands are in the works. Ultimately, the Tippy Type's value depends on how often one uses a laptop and their commitment to maintaining long nails. For those who frequently type on laptops, it may be a worthwhile investment.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-09 13:00:00-0400

Asus’ Zenbook S 16 is one of the first laptops to feature AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI processor, which is designed to outperform Intel and Qualcomm in gaming, content creation, and AI, all while being lighter and thinner than the MacBook Air. However, Asus faces stiff competition from Qualcomm’s new chips, which offer comparable performance and superior battery life. The Zenbook S 16 is a slim 16-inch laptop with a base configuration of 24GB of memory, a 1TB SSD, and AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 365 processor for $1,400. It features a 2880 x 1800 (3K) touchscreen OLED display and a 78Wh battery, weighing only 3.31 pounds. The laptop excels in performance, particularly in graphics, making it capable of gaming and content creation, outperforming Snapdragon laptops in these areas. However, its battery life is somewhat disappointing, lasting only 11 hours, which is less than some competitors. The Zenbook S 16 also struggles with accurate battery life estimations, leading to confusion about remaining power. While it includes an AI app, StoryCube, it failed to function as intended during testing. Overall, the Zenbook S 16 is a strong all-rounder for those seeking a powerful, portable machine, though it may not fully meet the performance claims made by AMD.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-09 09:00:00-0400
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 review: tried and true  ,https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables,"This is an article by The Verge. Of all the wearables Samsung launched in 2024, the $299.99 Galaxy Watch 7 is the least exciting. It’s not a totally new category like the Galaxy Ring or a new form factor like the Galaxy Watch Ultra. In a year when Samsung shook up its wearable lineup, the Galaxy Watch 7 is its stalwart constant. After spending the last three weeks with the Galaxy Ring and Ultra, I’ve come to appreciate the comfort and wearability of the Galaxy Watch 7. The slimmer profile and simpler circular display are significant advantages, especially compared to the bulkiness of the Ultra. However, the battery life remains a weakness, with only around 24 hours on a single charge. The Watch 7 features the new 3nm Exynos W1000 chip and an upgraded BioActive Sensor, but the performance improvements are minimal. Most new features focus on health metrics, which can be hit or miss. The Galaxy Watch 7 is a solid choice for those upgrading from older models or who find the Ultra too much watch for their needs. While it may not be exciting, it offers reliability and familiarity.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-05 09:00:00-0400

There’s no girl math in the world that can make the Breville Oracle Jet make sense for me, but boy is it nice to use. The $1,999.95 espresso machine has a touchscreen and connects to a wireless network for software updates. The Jet is an update to Breville’s high-end Oracle superautomatic machine, designed to simplify the espresso-making process. My husband, who typically avoids engaging with coffee machines, found the Oracle Jet less intimidating after a tutorial and was able to make Americanos successfully. While the machine feels like overkill for someone with my coffee knowledge, it offers convenience with features like a larger drip tray and front-access water tank. However, I struggled with adjusting the grind dose, which is imprecise and can affect shot consistency. The Oracle Jet also introduces a new feature for making “cold” espresso, which brews room-temperature shots to reduce ice melt in iced lattes. Despite its advanced technology, I prefer the simplicity of my Barista Express, as using an espresso machine is one of the few times I can disconnect from computers. Connectivity offers advantages, but some repairs can be complicated due to limited spare parts and documentation. Overall, while the Oracle Jet is impressive, I’m content with my current setup.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-04 10:00:00-0400
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review: the practical flip phone,https://www.theverge.com/24211507/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review-screen-battery-camera,"This is an article by The Verge. Look, fun is fun and all, but sometimes boring is better. A flip phone dripping with nostalgia that comes in bold colors and lets you run apps all willy-nilly on the cover screen? That’s fun. It’s also not the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. But while I thoroughly enjoyed using the Motorola Razr Plus — the fun flip phone — reliability wins out in the end. Samsung’s newest clamshell-style foldable is a light update on last year’s model. It costs $1,099, which is a hundred dollars more than last year but also just what flagship phones cost these days. The inner and outer screens get a little brighter in direct sunlight, there’s a slightly bigger battery, and there’s an upgraded main camera, plus the latest Qualcomm chipset, naturally. The Z Flip 6 hasn’t totally reached parity with slab phones; it’s certainly not the most fun flip phone. If I’d never picked up the Motorola Razr Plus, I’d think the Z Flip 6’s outer screen was pretty darn good. The Z Flip 6 comes with a proper always-on display this time around, but it lacks the sense of fun that I’d expect from a flip phone.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-03 09:00:00-0400

I’ve played around with a few DJI drones over the years but always found them to be too cumbersome to master and use spontaneously. The $349 HoverAir X1 from Zero Zero Robotics is different. This so-called “selfie drone” is so easy to use that it’s already an indispensable tool for my work and play, right out of the box. The HoverAir X1 is responsible for various shots used in my reviews, all made with just a touch of a button — no controller required. It launches quickly and can fit inside a pocket, making it convenient to take everywhere. The primary user interface consists of two buttons, allowing for easy selection of flight modes that lock the camera onto the user. While the X1 has limitations, such as a max video resolution of 2.7K and a lack of obstacle avoidance, its computer vision tracking is very good. The drone is surprisingly robust for its lightweight design, surviving several crashes. The HoverAir X1 excels at capturing moments for social media, doing 90 percent of what I want from a drone without unnecessary complexity. Overall, it offers a compelling option for those looking for a user-friendly and portable drone experience.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-03 05:00:00-0400
Surface Pro 11 review: tantalizingly close to the dream,https://www.theverge.com/24191243/microsoft-surface-pro-11-oled-review,"This is an article by The Verge. For 11 years, the Surface Pro has been Microsoft’s best articulation of its vision for the future of personal computing: the power of a Windows laptop, with the flexibility and battery life of a tablet. The Surface Pro 11 is supposed to have it all, and for the first time, it mostly does. Thanks to the new Snapdragon X processor, it’s the first Arm-based Surface Pro that runs Windows and most apps without tripping over itself. The Surface Pro 11 starts at $1,000, with various configurations available, including a top-of-the-line model priced at $2,550. The hardware is refined, featuring an OLED display that is bright and beautiful, though it can have a grainy appearance on white backgrounds. The new Flex Keyboard cover has Bluetooth connectivity, allowing it to function even when detached, and it feels comfortable to type on. The Surface Pro 11 runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform, combining laptop performance with tablet battery life, but app compatibility can still be an issue, especially for graphics-heavy applications. Battery life is generally good, but demanding tasks can significantly reduce it. The front camera, however, is less impressive, with a fish-eye effect that can be unflattering during video calls. Overall, while the Surface Pro 11 is a significant step forward, potential buyers may want to wait for further developments in Arm compatibility before making a purchase.",Science & Technology,The Verge,2024-08-02 09:00:00-0400
